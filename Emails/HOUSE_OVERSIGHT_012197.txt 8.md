Marie - I will not be able to get back to you until tomorrow. However, some of the questions he raised cause me 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012631 
some serious concern. 
1. Can we get a copy of the indictment (or can you tell me the nature of the crimes against the girls)? 
Certainly he should not get a copy of any indictment. 
2. When will it be possible to see the plea agreement so that we understand exactly what Epstein concedes to in the 
civil case? 
I don't think he should get the plea agreement either. 
3. Is there any cap or other limitation on attorney's fees that the defendant will pay in the civil case? 
I can't imagine he would be entitled to anything other than an hourly fee. 
4. What is the contemplated procedure for, and timing of, the payment of attorney's fees and costs? 
In any event, I need to consider these issues carefully and I cannot agree to any of these issues before we speak. I 
would suggest we plan on talking tomorrow at 12 pm if you are available. 
Jay
