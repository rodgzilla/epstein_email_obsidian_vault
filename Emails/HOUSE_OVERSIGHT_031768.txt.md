Trump called her "Horseface." President Trump on Tuesday called adult[[-]]film star Stormy Daniels "Horseface" 
and threatened [[To]] "go after" her after he won a court victory over his alleged mistress.

"Federal Judge throws out Stormy DaniaIs [sic] lawsuit versus Trump. Trump is entitled [[To]] full legal fees.' 
@FoxNews Great, now [[I]] can go after Horseface and her 3rd rate lawyer in the Great State of Texas. She will 
confirm the letter she signed! She knows nothing about me, a total con!' he tweeted. 
The tweet comes one day after a federal judge in California threw out Daniels's defamation lawsuit against 
Trump and ordered Daniels [[To]] repay the president's legal fees. 
Daniels's attorney, [[Michael]] Avenatti, responded by calling Trump a "disgusting misogynist" and a "liar" who 
has dishonored his family and country. 
"You are a disgusting misogynist and an embarrassment [[To]] the United States. Bring everything you have, 
because we are going [[To]] demonstrate [[To]] the world what a complete shyster and liar you are. How many other 
women did you cheat on your wife with while you had a baby at home?" he tweeted.
