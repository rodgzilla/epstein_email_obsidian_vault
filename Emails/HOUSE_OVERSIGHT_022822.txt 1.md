Hello Marty, 
Just following up on the email I sent you earlier this week requesting comment from Mr Epstein, or a 
representative of his, in regards a number of questions we had. I'm also cc-ing my colleague Tracie, as going 
forward she will be a better point of contact should you or Mr Epstein wish to respond. 
Kind regards, 
Matt

The questions we wanted to reach out to Mr Epstein for comment are listed below. Feel free to contact me 
on after reviewing. Kind regards - Matt 
A former employee has told us that Donald Trump attended Mr Epstein's Palm Beach estate on at least two occasions. Does Mr 
Epstein recall hosting Donald Trump at that residence? 
On one such occasion, it has been suggested to us that Mr Epstein and Donald Trump watched "young girls try on bikinis" while 
making comments on the their bodies." Does Mr Epstein have any comment? 
How does Mr Epstein respond to claims that women - some under the legal age of sexual consent - were used as "sex slaves" at his 
properties? 
A former employee of Mr Epstein has alleged to us that Mr Epstein sexually assaulted her on 
numerous occasions. Does Mr Epstein have a comment? 
Did or does Mr Epstein have cameras inside rooms at his Palm Beach residence? 
Did Mr Epstein remove those cameras before police raided the property as part of the investigation into alleged crimes? Did Mr 
Epstein ever hand over any recordings from any cameras at his properties to the authorities as part of his non-prosecution 
agreement? 
Does Mr Epstein have in his possession any video recordings of Donald Trump taken from inside his Palm Beach estate or any other 
residence? 
Did Mr Epstein hold sex parties at his residences involving girls under the age of sexual consent? Was Donald Trump ever present at 
any of these parties? 
Has Mr Epstein upheld the conditions of his sentencing and registered as a sex offender in all jurisdictions in which he is due to do so?

Does Mr Epstein have any comment regarding allegations made by a woman named in the media as Virginia Giuffre/Roberts relating 
to her being sexually abused by Mr Epstein or used as a "sex slave"?
