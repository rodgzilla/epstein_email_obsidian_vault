Boston / Bedford are not gateway airports [[To]] PBI. 
Only airports that are gateway into Palm Beach are: 
White Plains 
Teterboro 
Orlando 
Dulles 
Orlando 
Fortlauderdale 
Most operators are using Boca for arrivals when Trump is in town. Parking reservation at Boca are required 
since the ramp fill up. Other options is Fort Lauderdale when Boca is full. 
POTUS arrival — Friday, January 12th, time TBD (likely PM) 
POTUS departure — Monday, January 15th, time TBD (likely PM) 
Should [[I]] request parking at Boca? 
Thx
