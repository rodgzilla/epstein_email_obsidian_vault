Hi [[Lawrence]], 
just back [[From]] a long tour ,,on origins". 
As promised you will get my message promptly. 
As you may understand, before we start recruiting for the Festival our budget 
implies more freedom. Now [[I]] simply do not have the flexibility [[To]] decide so easily 
on amounts in „kilos". (especially as a prominent Nobel laureate shortly before 
deadline agreed [[To]] come and implied a pretty large sum). 
What [[I]] can offer you is 5k as a lump sum. This is the ultimate at the moment. 
[[I]] deeply regret these limitations but [[I]] cannot ignore redlines. 
So please let me know if you can or cannot come. 
As ever Jakob

Well it depends on UK.. if they can't do it, then alas, it would be the whole thing.. [[I]] could check for a 
discount ticket of course.. and maybe even economy class... There is also a small chance that [[I]] might do the 
event in UK with [[Noam Chomsky]], and [[I]] am wondering whether, if [[I]] could convince him [[To]] join me in a 
dialogue at your place whether that might change the dynamics of the event for you, and free up some more 
money perhaps..

Hi [[Lawrence]] 
your mail meets me on the way out [[To]] a week abroad. 
[[I]] need my financial colleague [[To]] decide. So, [[I]] shall be 
back at the end of this month.

Hi Jakob 
There has been a complication. The Gottingen event had [[To]] be cancelled so that means [[I]] now do not have an air ticket [[To]] Germany. [[I]] 
am going [[To]] check whether [[I]] can arrange anything in the Uk which might cover part of the cost for a new ticket. In the meantime [[I]] 
thought [[I]] should let you know and ask whether it is possible [[To]] cover part or all of the cost for a ticket.
