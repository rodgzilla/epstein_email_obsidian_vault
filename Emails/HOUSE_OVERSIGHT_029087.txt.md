Hey [[Jeffrey]], 
Thought [[I]]'d check in and see what's up on your end. 
- [[I]]'ve been watching closely Trump's appointees and there, he might be putting Balaji (a big bitcoiner) 
as FDA head, and Allison seems [[To]] be somewhat in favor of something like Bitcoin. And of course, 
Thiel has said that Bitcoin is what Paypal should have been... Curious [[To]] hear where your head is at 
on this matter. 
- Last week, [[I]] presented my research at Stanford's BPASE, it was well received. The most interesting 
thing [[I]] came up with for that is an inverse[[-]]input contract; [[I]].e., funds that are "locked" [[To]] be spent only 
in the case where there are other funds that are not used in a specific way. An example of something 
that could be built with this: a matching donation contract, where you agree [[To]] donate your money [[To]] 
charity if someone else donates [[To]] charity, and you would not be able [[To]] release your funds [[From]] that 
agreement until they use their funds not for charity. 
- [[I]]'m in Japan this week, teaching a class [[To]] 100 Japanese Engineers [[To]] get the up [[To]] speed on 
bitcoin (with DG). It's very interesting [[To]] see the trepidation first hand that they have with respect [[To]] 
the technology, despite their debit[[-]]based society being more geared for it in any case (DG felt that 
even putting Bitcoin in the course name would scare away students). One of my friends (a hedge 
fund manager) told me that female japanese engineers are very good, and drastically under[[-]]valued. [[I]] 
made sure [[To]] get a few invited [[To]] the class, we'll see if he's right. On the whole, it will be interesting [[To]] 
see the caliber of engineer Japan has [[To]] offer on this front. 
Best, 
Jeremy
