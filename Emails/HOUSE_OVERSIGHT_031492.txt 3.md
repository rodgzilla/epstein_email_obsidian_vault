As terrible as the system is and has been to you, I have to tell you one encouraging thing. Last Friday I spoke on a 
panel in DC on the justice system. I was seated next to Justice Breyer and got to know him a bit. For what it is 
worth, he certainly seem to understand that the system is broken and I hear this more and more. Indeed, he made it 
very clear that he thinks the sentencing system (which he helped form as a member of the Sentencing Commission) 
is broken and while you are past having to deal with that, I would like to think this raises some hope that the rest of 
the system will improve if others in his position feel the same. 
Tomorrow I go to Alabama to argue before the court of appeals regarding the constitutionality of Alabama's 
Community Notification Act, which the lower court struck down as unconstitutional already. Ultra right wing court 
and election year, so who knows; but these laws are so Draconian. 
I saw that the U.S. Attorney's office is appearing in your civil cases as well. Some strange folks in that 
office. Anyway, I will look forward to talking and while all the judges are going to be tough, Judges Marra and 
Johnson so far have not been rubber stamps for government in my case and that means something.
