Hi! Last night we confirmed a studio recording with an stunning soprano [[To]] record a new aria Fred [[Wrote]]. Its 
early 7:30[[-]]9pm on April 4. F really wants [[To]] see you, so is after that too late? Wanna join us somewhere [[To]] eat 
after? Wanna come [[To]] the studio? Fred will be playing the piano for the demo. Otherwise, we could have a 
visit anytime you want after the 4th. But if you can, the studio would be fun and [[I]] would love [[To]] have your 
input in the booth:). Tora and Miasha might come too. Its an awesome aria sung by a Vampiress who looks 
just like (better) Vanessa Williams [[From]] our day. ( The Miss USA that somehow had some haha nudie photos 
floating around). ANYWAY. .what do ya think?
