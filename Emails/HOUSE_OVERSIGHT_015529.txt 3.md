Hi Jack - sorry to trouble you.
But wondering if you know what documents are source for a new NY Daily News story - quoting what appears
to be a Juan Alessi deposition which mentions Andrew visits to PB mansion.
Daily News cites newly filed documents. I'm not aware of any new docs that quote Alessi on the issue of
Andrew.
Can u enlighten me?
Do you have access to those portions of the Alessi depo? Not sure which case it would come from.
Is the full transcript of our telephone interview w. 0 Virginia part of the public record?

I have a request from the press to provide it (s below), but I will only do that if it has been filed. °"/-
