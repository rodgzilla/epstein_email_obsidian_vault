We own 8000 shares on the thesis that their growing exposure to data center capex spend would be a big positive for 
the stock. 
Recommendation: Keep the stock and buy Aug $200 puts on the 8000 shares costing $6.50 or $52,000. Nothing has 
changed regarding their core business. Data center spending is not going to change based off this M&A transaction. 
However if I am wrong and the market further penalizes the stock at least our losses are contained. The stock has 
dropped $40 and I think we could easily recoup our premium if the market buys into the CEO's reason for the merger. 
If I never had a position I would absolutely buy the stock using options. I would be selling October $185 puts and buying 
Oct $220 calls costing 50c/share.
