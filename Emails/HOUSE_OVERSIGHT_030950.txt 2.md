Hi [[Darren]], 
Just checking back in on the Jawbone investment. Thanks for sending across your comments. If possible, we 
would like [[To]] avoid a situation where we recirculate the investment agreements in place with Jawbone's 
other investors, and our hope is that we can accommodate as many of your comments as possible short of 
taking that step. 
We think that the best way [[To]] address your comments would be [[To]] have Jawbone enter into a new purchase 
agreement covering both the preferred and the common stock being sold [[To]] Mort. Jawbone would make its 
representations and warranties anew upon the closing of the purchase agreement, so Mort would not be 
relying on the reps made back in June 2011, nor on the schedule of exceptions prepared in connection with 
the initial closing. The new purchase agreement would have the same closing conditions that applied [[To]] the 
initial closing of the JP Morgan investment. 
Given the affiliation between Mort, Hedosophia and Apoletto and their collective investment in preferred 
and common stock, we also want [[To]] propose that Mort (along with the other two parties) be treated as a 
"Major Investor" under the Investor Rights Agreement so long as their collective holdings of preferred and 
common stock remains at least equal [[To]] 2,000,000 shares. We intend [[To]] do this with a side letter that would 
not require the signature of the other parties [[To]] those documents. You have already seen the draft 
amendment that would expand the definition of "Registrable Securities" in the investor rights agreement [[To]] 
include the common stock being purchased by Mort, and we do anticipate that our principal investors will 
quickly sign that document once we circulate it. 
You had indicated a desire [[To]] have JP Morgan approve the sale of Series 5 Preferred outside of the existing 
purchase agreement. As [[I]] indicated [[To]] you on the phone, we do not think that this is necessary, but we are 
willing [[To]] obtain [[From]] them an acknowledgement [[To]] that effect prior [[To]] the closing of Mort's investment. 
We do believe, however, that various of your other requests for change in the investor documents would 
require a broader amendment and restatement of the applicable documents, and some of them concern 
business points that were the [[Subject]] of specific negotiation with JP Morgan and others of our investors in 
prior rounds. These points include your comments [[To]] the drag along rights, the registration rights, the 
information rights and the venue provisions. We would like those terms [[To]] remain as we had negotiated 
them with JP Morgan. 
If you are comfortable with the approach outlined in this email, we can get you draft documents, including a 
draft updated Schedule of Exceptions, tomorrow for your review and approval. Please let me know.
