Dear Mr. Link: 
A transcript made public today show how Ghislaine Maxwell's legal team fought for and ultimately won a broad protective 
order in the lawsuit filed by accuser Sarah Ransome against your client Jeffrey Epstein. It also shows the Maxwell legal 
team's concern about the media coverage, especially from the Miami Herald, weeks before it published today's bombshell 
investigation today. 
My questions are: 
What is your response to the Miami Herald story published today? 
How would you respond to the series' allegations that there has been a more than decade-long cover-up of Epstein and 
his powerful associates, including by Trump's current secretary of labor Alexander Acosta? 
Please reply ASAP as I am on deadline. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 022998 
Thank you,
