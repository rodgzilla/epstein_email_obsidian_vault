Eva is my friend there who will host us. She is very close friend with mette as well. 
Eva and I are still trying to get mette to join at the last moment. 
She and her family own 80% or so of Austrian media (Heute etc). She is describing program below. 
The plan would be that we arrive to Vienna on Thursday 17th mid day. 
On Thursday there is a big Premiere of Mozart La clemenza de Tito and we go to that. 
ON Friday Eva is organizing a dinner/reception with her friends. We can schedule some other 
meetings/visits during day. 
On Saturday the night starts at 5pm and goes through early next morning. 
leave first flight Sunday morning for San Francisco to meet Bill. 
If you are staying in Vienna and have time (and like Eva) you should go to her brunch. 
How this seems to you???
