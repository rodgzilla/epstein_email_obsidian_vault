I'll soon send a cleaner version of this and other coverage, but wanted to share the article just posted in the 
AmLaw Litigation Daily. A personal thanks to Dan for speaking to the reporter, and Nima for feeding us case 
documents and insights.

A Master at Work: Dissecting the Closing Argument in Latham's Huge Win for Middle Eastern Bank 
Jenna Greene08/14/2016 
For Latham & Watkins, defending a Middle Eastern bank accused of stealing trade secrets from a plucky 
American entrepreneur could have been a tough sell to a federal jury in Orange County, California. 
[http://www.law.com/image/LitDaily/DailyDicta.jpg]The stakes were high--more than half a billion dollars in 
damages--and some of the facts were, ahem, challenging. 
How did Latham lawyers turn a potentially unsympathetic narrative into a unanimous win for Dubai-based 
Emirates NBD Bank PJSC on Thursday? 
A look at closing arguments by Latham partner Kathryn Ruemmler, who made her first in-court appearance 
since she stepped down as White House counsel in 2014, is revealing in a watch-the-master-at-work kind of 
way. 
Along with Latham partners Daniel Schecter and Dean Dunlavey, she faced off against an equally formidable 
opponent: Boies, Schiller & Flexner partner William Isaacson, who wasnamed a litigator of the 
year<http://www.americanlawyer.com/id= 1202745123270/Litigator-of-the-Year-William-Isaacson-of-Boies-
Schiller> by The American Lawyer in 2015. 
Ruemmler parachuted into the case on May 20, replacing Steven Bauer. He had another case (on behalf of 
Pacific Gas & Electric<http://www.therecorder.com/id=1202764714611/Split-Verdict-in-PGE-Pipeline-Blast-
Case?slreturn=20160712215338>) going to trial at the same time and couldn't convince U.S. District Judge 
James Selna to push back the trial date, which had already been delayed several times. 
This was the lay of the land: Two weeks before, the Los Angeles Times on May 8 had run a lengthy 
feature<http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-infospan-lawsuit-20160508-story.html> that was distinctly 
sympathetic to the plaintiff, Farooq Bajwa. A former computer components manufacturer/ El Pollo Loco 
franchise owner, his latest venture was a company called InfoSpan Inc. 
Bajwa is portrayed as a visionary who had an idea to allow foreign workers to easily and cheaply send funds 
back to relatives in their home country via the internet or cell phone. 
"I realized I might make a big difference in this world not only helping these underprivileged people who don't 
have bank accounts, I will also be helping bring an economic revolution," Bajwa, 64, told the paper. "I had 
very big dreams." 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012038 
But after he struck a deal with Emirates NBD to roll out his product, SpanCash, he claimed the bank stole his 
proprietary technology, killed the deal and ruined his company. (Though it's hard to feel too sorry for him--
he's pictured in front of his house, a mansion that would put Versailles to shame. In this David-and-Goliath 
story, he's a David from the 1 percent.) 
Bajwa sought $554 million plus punitive damages on trade secret misappropriation and misrepresentation 
claims. 
Trial began on July 26 in U.S. District Court for Central District of California. On Aug. 10, Ruemmler and 
Isaacson summed up their opposing positions in closing arguments. 
Let's take a look. 
I Isaacson, who did not respond to a request for comment, led with one of his strongest cards: USA! USA! 
"We as a country, made up of flawed people, come together as one of the greatest countries on Earth, because 
we are a nation of laws," he said, according to a transcript of the proceedings. "This was about hard work and 
what happens when your work is destroyed and taken, how you're entitled to be treated under the laws of the 
United States." 
For Ruemmler, the appeal was not emotional or jingoistic. It was rational all the way. 
Her first line: "Mr. Bajwa has come up with an interesting story, but it's not what happened." 
And then, in the most matter-of-fact, conversational way, she annihilated his case. 
"There are at least five fatal flaws in Mr. Bajwa's case, and any one of those alone sinks his case. Any one," 
she said, according to the transcript. 
Bajwa couldn't prove that SpanCash was ever fully functional and commercially ready, Ruemmler said. In 
fact, she argued, it was never even a real product. 
Further, she said, Bajwa didn't prove that the technology or platform was comprised of any trade secrets; or 
that Emirates Bank stole SpanCash; or that it ever used it. Finally, Bajwa didn't prove InfoSpan suffered any 
damages, she said. 
Some of her turns of phrase are refreshingly non-lawyerly. "Sham is going down there... It's not as if these 
guys were exactly rubes...This is some flimflam thing... One of the many, many dog-ate-my-homework 
excuses ....This is an absolute double-down lie." 
The overall effect: she simplified without being condescending. 
But there was still a hurdle for Emirates. Or as Latham's Schecter put it in an interview, "There are some facts 
we wouldn't script." 
After the bank terminated its agreement with InfoSpan and demanded its investment back, Infospan's deputy 
CEO, Larry Scudder, was arrested when he tried to leave the UAE. 
"At the Dubai Airport that day, the Dubai police arrested Mr. Scudder after he presented his passport at an 
electronic terminal. Police told Mr. Scudder that a charge of criminal fraud had been filed against him for 
$1,465,000. Mr. Scudder was handcuffed and marched through the airport and then held in police detention 
facilities and interrogated," the complaint states. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012039 
He was handcuffed to a chair, then transferred to a cell with 30 people before being released 19 hours later, at 
1 am. And then, the police kept his passport for six months before he could finally leave the country. 
On the stand, he cried when he spoke about the ordeal. 
Isaacson in his closing repeatedly called it extortion. "Because when the bank held Mr. Scudder's passport--I'm 
sorry, caused his passport to held, that just didn't cause personal pain for Mr. Scudder," he said. "What it did 
was give the opportunity for the bank to control the technology, to control the situation, because now InfoSpan 
couldn't compete in the UAE because of the fears that this type of thing would happen. And it also gave him 
the opportunity to try and extort money and control of the technology from InfoSpan." 
How do you counter that? 
Ruemmler was not available for an interview, but Schecter said pretrial research showed people expect that if 
you do business overseas, you'll comply with the laws of the foreign country. And in UAE, this is how they 
handle fraud. 
"Judge Selna has instructed you that filing a criminal complaint in Dubai for fraud is a common practice and 
that if you've been cheated, that's what you're supposed to do," Ruemmler said. 
What about Scudder's emotional testimony? 
She undercut it without coming across as callous--a fine line. 
"Now, I have to mention the tears. And this is the only thing I'm going to say about it," Ruemmler said. "He 
was detained for less than 24 hours, nine years ago; and then, he was in his corporate apartment and had 
$300,000 to live for, like, about six months. I'm just going to say this: I will leave to you to evaluate the 
sincerity of those tears in light of all the other evidence that you have heard in this case." 
And then she immediately talked about how he "basically, had faked a document." 
It worked. After about a day of deliberation, the jury found across the board for Emirates NBD Bank. 
"It was a binary case--either they lied or we lied," said Schecter. "The plaintiff's strategy was all or nothing. 
There were no off-ramps for the jury." 
The Latham team also included counsel Andrew Fossum and associates Nima Mohebbi, Stephanie Grace, 
Jonathan Sandler, Jacquelyn Levien, Elizabeth Greenman, Pushkal Mishra and Tom Rickeman. 
In a statement to The Lit Daily, Lubna Qassim, chief group general counsel and company secretary of the 
Emirates NBD, said, "While there was no basis for this case being tried in U.S. courts, Emirates NBD Bank is 
deeply gratified by the jury's decision and appreciates the court's commitment to ensuring a fair trial."
