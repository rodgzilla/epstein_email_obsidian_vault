Hope you are satisfied with the outcome all things considered. 
Ridiculous article. All of sudden the NPA in 's case goes [[From]] no 
jurisdiction even [[To]] prosecute [[To]] you avoiding a possible life 
sentence. Moronic. 
Man [[I]] sure would like [[To]] see you getting some in the [[W]] column though and 
some press that at least presents the true facts that some of the [[Girls]] have 
admitted under oath. Still a story no one ever has heard and they are 
compelling facts. 
Good Shabbos. 
The numerous young women who say they were sexually abused by 
wealthy, Clinton[[-]]linked financier [[Jeffrey]] [[Epstein]] no longer appear set [[To]] 
testify after a last[[-]]minute settlement was reached in a closely[[-]]watched civil 
lawsuit against the registered sex offender.
