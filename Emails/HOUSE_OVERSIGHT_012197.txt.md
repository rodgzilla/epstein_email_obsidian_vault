Subject RE: Meeting 
Judge Johnson has duty next week. 
Jay — [ hate to have to be firm about this, but we need to wrap this up by Monday. II will not miss my 
indictment date when this has dragged on for several weeks already and then, if things fall apart, be left in 
a less advantageous position than before the negotiations: [ have had an 82-page pros memo and 53-page 
indictment sitting on the shelf since May to engage in these negotiations. There has to be an ending date, 
and that date is Monday. 
A. Marie Villafaria 
Assistant U.S. Attorney
