Keep getting calls [[From]] that guy doing a book on you -- John Connolly. He seems very interested in 
your relationship with the news media. [[I]] told him you were a hell of a guy:) One oddity: he said he had 
been told that that quote [[From]] Trump about you in the original NY Mag story had been manufactured. 
ie, that [[I]] did not actually speak [[To]] Donald. Which is bull shit of course. [[I]] am sure that is what Trump 
told him as they have been getting a lot of questions [[From]] reporters about you. 
He actually seemed [[To]] be a sensible guy/solid reporter -- just [[From]] the few conversations [[I]] had with 
him. [[I]] think he is close [[To]] finishing up. 
Did you ever speak [[To]] him?
