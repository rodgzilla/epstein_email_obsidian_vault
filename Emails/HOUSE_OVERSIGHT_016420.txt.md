Hi Sue,
Regarding your first question: pursuant to Civil Rights Law§ 50-b, our office's practice in appellate sex
crimes matters is to file documents under seal. This is not particular to People v. Epstein; it is routine
across our appellate filings. My understanding is that it is also the Appellate Division's (the court's)
practice to maintain such seal.
That being said, I have discussed your second question with our attorneys. If the Post petitions the
court, and the court asks the People for our positon, we will not oppose the petition for a redacted brief.
Thanks.
