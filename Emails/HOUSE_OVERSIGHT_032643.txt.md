this was just tweeted by famous saudi opposition @mujtahidd.. almost 2 million followers.. 
#Trump MBS scandal involving President @realDonaldTrump and Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman... 
Following @realDonaldTrump's visit [[To]] SA, US stance on Saudi affairs changed especially on competition 
between MBS & MBN and Qatar siege. 
MBS = Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman (de facto [[King]]) 
MBN = Mohammad bin Nayef (deposed Saudi Crown Prince and Interior Minister) 
Prior [[To]] @realDonaldTrump, US institutions stood firmly with MBN throughout Obama's presidency. This was 
reaffirmed in a letter [[To]] the [[King]]. 
After @realDonaldTrump's Riyadh visit, he changed the US stance on the MBS v MBN power struggle and 
forced the establishment [[To]] back MBS. 
Past US administrations were keen on avoiding strife within GCC: This is because American interests cannot be 
upheld without a harmonic GCC. 
That was until @realDonaldTrump's return [[From]] Saudi upon which Qatar siege began and he openly supported 
it contradicting Defence&State Dept

More bizarrely; MBS has a secure direct line [[To]] Trump like no other leader has - not even Israeli Netanyahu & 
British May... 
The following story explains MBS's 'special' influence over @realDonaldTrump - even if it means 
compromising America's national interests... 
During @realDonaldTrump's Riyadh visit in May 2017 a private yacht discreetly arrived at Jeddah Port; heavily 
guarded and identity hidden. 
Even the Port's authorities were not allowed near it. Only a number of individuals reached it - delivering several 
boxes of cash ($1bn USD). 
After loading the boxes, the yacht disappeared. The operation lasted hours & was kept secret as was yacht's 
identity, origin and destination 
It transpired [[From]] MBS's inner circles that the $ lbn was [[From]] MBS himself & the yacht belonged indirectly [[To]] 
@Trump Organisation. #Trump MBS
