the mathematical model. is quite beautiful, though the basic rules are simple , once they have run over and 
over again, and produced a result you cannot tease them out by any form of reductionism. or 
algorithm, just like the series 7- 21 -37... cannot be found by alogrithm, it is simply the difference of 
cubes, . Have you written about the iran deal?

What you suggest is very much the model that has been current in the behavioral sciences for many years. It has a 
record of colossal failure, and for good reasons, I think. It's disproven, but keeps coming back, most recently with Big 
Data illusions. 
A child doesn't grow arms and legs rather than wings, or a mammalian vs insect visual system, the way an ant searches 
for food. Rather, the path of development is sharply restricted (and evolution follows constraints too). Acquisition of 
language (and other cognitive achievements) seems very much like physical growth. 
Highly contentious in the field, but in my opinion that's a comment on the failures of the field.
