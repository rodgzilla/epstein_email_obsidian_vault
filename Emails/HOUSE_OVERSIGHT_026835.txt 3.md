Dear Vinoda and Bob, 
Please see attached the last version of the revised draft letter. We have made some modifications and amendments 
we submit to your proposal. You can finalize the letter as it suits you. We strongly recommend to wait Wednesday 
or Tuesday this week before sending the letter as Amnesty International will issue on Wednesday 24th February 
its worldwide report on human right situation. It is highly probable that major statement will be made on Mr. 
Wade case in the report on Senegal, which will give us more input for the letter. 
Many thanks and best regards.
