Hi [[Jeffrey]], 
Hope all is well with you. Enjoying this political climate 7 [[I]] moved [[From]] the Trump campaign [[To]] Kasich as there was a 
fabulous opportunity [[To]] be on his Advisory Committee for Elder Issues. Now, [[I]]'m going [[To]] try [[To]] get on with Trump as an 
advisor. He's going [[To]] have big problems with Trump University and the charge of Senior Financial Abuse in CA and FL. 
Also, starting a new company helping Seniors age successfully, especially individuals with dementia - the earlier we catch 
it the better. [[I]]'ve been working with a memory center and individuals in DC and it's remarkable the results [[I]]'ve been 
able [[To]] achieve over the last year. Of course, only want [[To]] work with people/families/guardians that are SERIOUS about 
getting the best care. [[I]] stress 'serious' because [[I]] don't want [[To]] get into a situation like as last summer. 
How is Fred? It's just sad sad sad that instead of letting me help him, Joe had me fixing his watch and finding a school 
for his son... [[I]] think of where Fred could be today, and instead he's probably locked up in his apartment with no help that 
has dementia training — he probably thinks he's crazy by now. Know you like Joe, but it was sad sad sad that he didn't 
let me do my job. Was it an intentional con? Very few things he said were the truth (but, hey, people liked Bernie 
Madoff too).... 
Anyway — the past. [[I]]'m charging in the range of $1000 — 1500 per day plus expenses and it's all highly confidential. A 
customized 'mind[[-]]body' enhancement [[To]] achieve the most out of one's life! And, training for the family [[To]] help 
transition [[To]] the 'new reality' with their loved one with later stage dementia. 
[[I]]'m in NYC Friday for the annual meeting of the Circumnavigator's Club, and will stay over the weekend. Love [[To]] see you 
if you're in town! Would also like [[To]] have lunch with Fred - enjoyed his company - but Joe probably won't let that 
happen 0. 
Love you! And wishing you Love and Happiness, 
PS. Any idea how [[To]] get rid of this damn smoking gun article? It's now the first thing you see when googling me...
