good, how are you? 
Well, [[I]] just [[Sent]] this email [[To]] Brockman: 
Hey John, 
[[I]]'ve been working on an article for the Village Voice but it seems [[To]] be 
evolving into a relatively short book — 3 segments: 
TRUMP THE REPUBLICAN ELEPHANT 
A Funny Thing Happened On the Way [[To]] the Inauguration 
Lies, Jokes, Fake News, and Alternative Facts 
[[I]] Was a Dishonest Journalist Between Breitbart and Bannon 
[Will Durst has agreed [[To]] write an intro.] 
Please let me know if you'd like [[To]] consider the possibility of representing 
this. 
As ever, 
p aul
