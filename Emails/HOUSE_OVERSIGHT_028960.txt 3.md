The hardware of vision is an input system, It's the software that [[I]]'m referring [[To]] . 
On Thursday, December 24, 2015, [[Noam Chomsky]] <__________________> [[Wrote]]: 
We don't teach children language either, contrary [[To]] many beliefs. The visual grammar just grows, and as is known, 
can develop in various ways depending on early experience. Same with the language grammar, though the period in 
which experience has a shaping effect is much longer. 
However, there are fundamental differences between vision and language. Can send you a recent paper about it if 
you like. Vision is an input system. Language isn't. It's an internal capacity, a system of knowledge, which is used [[To]] 
process input and also [[To]] produce thoughts (sometimes externalized). Seems also [[To]] be modality independent. And 
their properties look wholly different, so it's hard [[To]] see how one could piggy[[-]]back on the other.
