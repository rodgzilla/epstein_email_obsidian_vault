The hardware of vision is an input system, It's the software that I'm referring to .

We don't teach children language either, contrary to many beliefs. The visual grammar just grows, and as is known,

However, there are fundamental differences between vision and language. Can send you a recent paper about it if 
you like. Vision is an input system. Language isn't. It's an internal capacity, a system of knowledge, which is used to 
process input and also to produce thoughts (sometimes externalized). Seems also to be modality independent. And 
their properties look wholly different, so it's hard to see how one could piggy-back on the other.
