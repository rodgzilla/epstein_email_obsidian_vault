Will, if you're concerned that people might want to slice it up, then we likely should not go with the FTP site 
(option A), because the link would not be protected and someone could find it. Posting on Steptoe's YouTube 
channel (option B) with secured settings would make the link only accessible to those who receive the link. It 
would also provide reporters with a faster way to view the video since they would not have to download 
it. Does that make sense?
