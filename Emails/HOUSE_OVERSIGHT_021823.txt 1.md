I have to hand it to I'm sure she deserves the pretty penny she has made for her effort 
. She has certainly caught the imagination of a public hungry for salacious fiction. To suggest her 
story is anything other than that, a fiction , is ludicrous. Presidents at dinner on caribean islands. ( 
clinton was never ever there, easy to confirm ). Sharing a bath with a Prince ( bathtub too small 
even for one adult ). sex slave being paid thousands of dollars. ( while at the exact same time, 
she was working as a hostess in a burger bar ). being lent out to a prime minister though this prime 
mininster, never out of sight of his massive security detail also never visited the island„ sex on a 
small airplane with a famous lawyer while the other passengers must have been all looking out the 
window during the event . I would have thought that her fabrications were readilly apparent, but 
now , being asked to deny what the press has termed her" allegations" is frankly silly. ok, to play 
along I deny each and every allegation . The only person she didn't suggest she was forced to have 
sex with , was Bilbo Baggins. , maybe its in the sequel.
