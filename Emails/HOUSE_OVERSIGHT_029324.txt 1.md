Reply-[[To]]: 
My apologies -- for the Obama BRAIN initiative, [[I]] need [[To]] work at MIT 
today [[To]] coordinate the activities of a bunch of groups for a Monday 
deadline. [[I]]'ll see if [[I]] can get the plane fare refunded by our travel 
agent. Very sorry for the late notice... 
Best, 
[[Ed]]
