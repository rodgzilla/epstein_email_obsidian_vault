All, 
[[I]] just received a copy of the audio recording with Q&A. The video recording will be available mid-[[To]]-late 
afternoon. As the file will be too large [[To]] distribute [[Via]] email, we have two posting options: 
; 
a) Upload [[To]] Steptoe's FTP site, where the file is public but not (easily) discoverable [[To]] the casual Steptoe.[[Com]] 
browser or searcher. We would send reporters the link, at which point they would download the recording in 
order [[To]] watch it. 
B) Upload the file [[To]] Steptoe's YouTube channel and set the security around the video so that it's only 
watchable by someone who has the link. It would not be discoverable by anyone who doesn't have the exact 
URL (searching or browsing). The advantage with this option is the reporters could watch the video [[Via]] the 
YouTube player, rather than downloading a file. 
[[I]] believe our preference is the second choice? 
Thanks, 
[[Kathy]]
