ok [[To]] all 
On Tue, [[Nov 12]], 2013 at 3:51 PM, [[Wrote]]: 
[[Jeffrey]], 
[[I]] spoke [[To]] Gary and he agrees [[To]] make a counter offer, do you agree with the following: 
-Counter the offer at $2.750M 
-deal [[To]] include my FAR125 certificate, along with the company name: JEGE, Inc. this provides the buyer with ease of 
transition and keeps the B727 on its current FAR125, tremendous value [[To]] buyer,. 
-Buyer understands purchase is "As Is" but has the opportunity [[To]] visually inspect the aircraft in Palm Bch along with my 
records. 
-closing [[To]] be on December 30th 2013. 
-Buyer will pay round trip repositioning expense Brunswick GA [[To]] Palm Beach and return [[To]] Brunswick if buyer declines 
the aircraft (fuel cost round trip $14,930.00). 
-Seller will deduct the reposition expense if buyer proceeds with purchase. (fuel expense [[To]] fly B727 [[To]] Palm Beach is 
$7,465.00). 
is this approved? 
thank you, 
[[Larry]]
