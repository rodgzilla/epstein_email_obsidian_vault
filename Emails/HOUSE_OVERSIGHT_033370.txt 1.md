Jeffrey, 
I spoke to Gary and he agrees to make a counter offer, do you agree with the following: 
-Counter the offer at $2.750M 
-deal to include my FAR125 certificate, along with the company name: JEGE, Inc. this provides the buyer with ease of 
transition and keeps the B727 on its current FAR125, tremendous value to buyer,. 
-Buyer understands purchase is "As Is" but has the opportunity to visually inspect the aircraft in Palm Bch along with my 
records. 
-closing to be on December 30th 2013. 
-Buyer will pay round trip repositioning expense Brunswick GA to Palm Beach and return to Brunswick if buyer declines 
the aircraft (fuel cost round trip $14,930.00). 
-Seller will deduct the reposition expense if buyer proceeds with purchase. (fuel expense to fly B727 to Palm Beach is 
$7,465.00). 
is this approved? 
thank you, 
Larry
