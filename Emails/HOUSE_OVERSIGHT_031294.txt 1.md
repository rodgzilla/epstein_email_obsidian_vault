Hi Richard - 
[[I]] certainly will. But perhaps you can clarify something for me before [[I]] put all this together for the donation. 
[[Jeffrey]] [[Epstein]] had asked [[To]] submit the letter and invoice [[To]] [[Peggy Siegal]] instead, and she had supplied 
different information than below. 
Please advice how best [[To]] proceed. 
Best, 
Steven
