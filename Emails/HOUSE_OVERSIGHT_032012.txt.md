HOUSE OVERSIGHT 032012 
Did the British promise the Arabs independence in 
Palestine? 
In July 1915, Hussein ibn 'Ali, the Sherif of 
Mecca, [[Sent]] a letter [[To]] Sir Henry MacMahon, 
the High Commissioner for Egypt, informing 
him of the terms for Arab participation in the 
war against the Turks. The letters between 
Hussein and Mac[[-]]Mahon that followed outlined 
the areas that Britain was prepared [[To]] cede [[To]] 
the Arabs in exchange for their help.

Trump's Saudi Arms Sale Is About Politics and 
Economics, Not Security 
by [[Mitchell Bard]] 
President Trump wants [[To]] use his emergency 
powers [[To]] sell billions of dollars' worth of 
weapons [[To]] Saudi Arabia on national security 
grounds. Congress wants [[To]] stop the sale 
because of lingering anger over Saudi abuses 
and the murder of journalist Jamal 
Khashoggi, and the usurpation of its legal 
authority [[To]] review arms sales. Both sides are 
ingenuous. The willingness [[To]] sell the Saudis - 
weapons has little [[To]] do with American national security, and 
everything [[To]] do with economics and politics.

Arizona[[-]]Israel Cooperation 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 032017 
The U.S.-Israel relationship is based on the twin pillars of shared 
values and mutual interests. Given this commonality of interests and 
beliefs, it should not be surprising that support for Israel is one of the 
most pronounced and consistent foreign policy values of the American 
people. 
Today's interdependent global economy requires that trade policy be 
developed at the national and state level. Many states have 
recognized the opportunity for realizing significant benefits by seeking 
[[To]] increase trade with Israel. Arizona is one of 33 states that have 
cooperative agreements with Israel.
