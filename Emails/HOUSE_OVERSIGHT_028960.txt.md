Very interesting topics. Would like to hear more from you about them, when we have a chance. Is it worldwide, or 
mostly here? 
My impression is that the fear is mostly in the US. There's nothing in (much more vulnerable) Europe comparable to the 
Visa Waiver program (insanely targeting Iran, which has not been involved in terrorism, while exempting Saudi Arabia, 
the source of almost all jihadi terrorism). Or Trump-style ban them all. Or Cruz-style carpet-bomb them. For a long 
time, probably back to colonial days, this has been a very frightened country, maybe the safest in the world but also the 
most frightened. Impressions. 
Sometimes it's quite weird. By accident, I took the first flight PanAm 103 after the Lockerbie bombing, together with an 
old friend, a veteran Middle East correspondent. It must have been the safest flight in human history. The plane was 
empty. We were bumped up to first class because there was no one there.
