Boris: 
Here is the information sheet for Jeffrey to buy tickets. Tell him to use my name and the name of Magdalena 
Schuster on the email below. They've already approved him to buy tickets to Lifeball and the Gala dinner 
which happens right before the ball. I hope you guys are all planning to attend the dinner as well. You can tell 
your friend Jeffrey that he should buy the Mini car for me as a thank you. =) 
I'm getting in to Vienna on Friday afternoon. Let's get together on Friday night. 
See you soon, 
Kevin
