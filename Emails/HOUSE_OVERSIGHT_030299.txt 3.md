IT looks like New York billionaire financier [[Jeffrey]] [[Epstein]] got off easy when he was hit 
with a charge of soliciting a prostitute for a "happy ending" in Palm Beach. 
Because if Palm Beach police had their way, [[Epstein]], 53 - who surrendered last Sunday 
and is out on $3,000 bail - might have been whacked with far more serious charges of 
paying underage [[Girls]] for sex. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030303 
But a state grand jury found the witnesses in the case were not credible and threw out all 
but the single charge of soliciting a hooker in his luxurious Palm Beach home. [[Epstein]]'s 
lawyers and friends now say he's the hapless victim of a vendetta by Palm Beach Police 
Chief [[Michael]] Reiter, whom they describe as a "born[[-]]again nut case." 
According [[To]] the police investigation, a copy of which was obtained by the Palm Beach 
Post, detectives took statements [[From]] 17 witnesses and five alleged victims. Haley 
Robson, 20, a Palm Beach Community College student who described herself as "like a 
Heidi Fleiss," says she got naked [[To]] give [[Epstein]] a massage, then brought him six [[Girls]] 
ages 14[[-]]16 for massages and sex at his home. She said they were paid $200 per session. 
Cops also allege that [[Epstein]]'s personal assistant, Sarah Kellen, who hasn't been charged, 
set up the liaisons and put fresh sheets on the massage table and supplied massage oils. 
Police searched through [[Epstein]]'s garbage and retrieved sex toys and feminine hygiene 
products. 
[[Epstein]]'s Palm Beach lawyer, [[Jack Goldberger]], told Page Six that the Florida state 
attorney concluded the cops had looked at evidence [[From]] a "one[[-]]sided perspective." He 
added that [[Epstein]] had passed an extensive lie[[-]]detector test in which he was grilled about 
underage [[Girls]]. 
[[Epstein]]'s New York lawyer, Gerald Lefcourt, said, "The prosecutor didn't want [[To]] bring 
any charges in this case, but because of the craziness of this police chief, we have the 
charge of solicitation." 
Last night, WPTV in Palm Beach reported that one reason Robson's testimony may have 
been dismissed is the kinky Web page she has on MySpace featuring photos of her 
female friends playing with sex toys. One friend even uses the name "Pimpin Made EZ." 
Robson, who isn't charged, also writes, "Do what you do [[To]] make that money, life is 
a gamble. Stay hustling." 
A spokeswoman for Reiter said, "We think our investigation speaks for itself"

JAIL LOOMS FOR SEX[[-]]CASE MOGUL 
September 20, 2007 -- THE sordid sex case involving [[Jeffrey]] [[Epstein]] may 
be coming [[To]] an unhappy ending -with a plea deal that would put the 
publicity[[-]]shy billionaire behind bars for 15 months for allegedly soliciting 
underage teen [[Girls]] for sex at his Palm Beach mansion. 
Sources tell Page Six that [[Epstein]]'s high[[-]]powered lawyers - including [[Alan]] 
Dershowitz, Gerald Lefcourt, [[Roy Black]] and Kenneth [[Starr]] - have been 
negotiating a deal with federal prosecutors who are probing, among other 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030304 
things, whether the gray[[-]]haired money manager paid West Palm Beach [[Girls]] 
for sex or transported them across state lines. [[Epstein]] is currently charged by 
the State of Florida with soliciting young prostitutes for sex - but federal 
charges would be far more serious. 
The Palm Beach Post reported yesterday that [[Epstein]] is very close [[To]] a deal 
with the feds that would send him [[To]] jail for 11/2 [[To]] 2 years. Sources tell us that 
while a deal has not yet solidified, what's under discussion is a guilty plea [[To]] 
at least one charge in exchange for a sentence of 15 months in a Florida state 
prison, followed by 15 months of home confinement. That would be a fraction 
of the time he would have [[To]] serve if he were [[To]] be convicted by a jury. 
[[Epstein]]'s spokesman, [[Howard Rubenstein]], said his client would have no 
comment. Dershowitz also declined [[To]] comment late yesterday. 
Palm Beach police records show that on March 15, 2005, a 14[[-]]year[[-]]old girl 
alleged she had visited [[Epstein]]'s estate, where she partially stripped and 
gave him a massage during which he "pulled out a purple vibrator" and used it 
on her in exchange for $300. A further probe uncovered five young women 
who said [[Epstein]] had masturbated and touched their genitals during 
massages, the records state. A woman named Haley Robson - who 
described herself as "like a Heidi Fleiss" - later admitted bringing six [[Girls]] 
between the ages of 14 and 16 [[To]] [[Epstein]]'s house, according [[To]] cops. 
Despite the allegations, [[Epstein]] was only nailed on a single charge of 
soliciting a hooker - but it sparked a federal probe. [[Epstein]]'s lawyers and 
friends have insisted he was the hapless victim of a vendetta by Palm Beach 
Police Chief [[Michael]] Reiter, whom they described as a "born[[-]]again nutcase."

Police chiefs reputation helps discredit attacks 
By [[Larry]] Keller 
Palm Beach Post - Monday, August 14, 2006 
In the case of Palm Beach financier [[Jeffrey]] [[Epstein]], it seems, at times, as if two men are 
accused of wrongdoing: [[Epstein]] and Palm Beach Police Chief [[Michael]] Reiter. 
[[Epstein]], 53, was indicted last month on a charge of felony solicitation of prostitution 
solely because of Reiter's "craziness," one of [[Epstein]]'s lawyers said. His department 
disseminated "a distorted view of the case" and behaved in a "childish" manner when the 
grand jury didn't indict [[Epstein]] on the charges it sought, another [[Epstein]] lawyer 
complained. 
[[To]] hear the [[Epstein]] camp tell it, Reiter, 48, is a loose cannon better suited [[To]] be the 
sheriff of Mayberry. They whisper that he's embroiled in a messy divorce. 
Reiter did in fact file for divorce [[From]] his wife, (NAME REMOVED), last year, after 24 
years of marriage. They have a son, 18, and a daughter, 14. The couple is scheduled [[To]] go 
[[To]] mediation next week, Aug. 16. Nothing in the court file suggests their split is 
particularly ugly. 
Reiter incurred the wrath of the [[Epstein]] camp as well as the state attorneys office for two 
reasons. First, he pressed for [[Epstein]] [[To]] be charged with the more serious crimes of 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030305 
sexual activity with minors. Second, he slammed State Attorney Barry Krischer in blunt 
language seldom used by one law[[-]]enforcement official concerning another because of 
what he perceived as that office's mishandling of the case. 
In a letter [[To]] Krischer written May [[1]], Reiter called his actions in the [[Epstein]] case "highly 
unusual." He added, "[[I]] must urge you [[To]]... consider if good and sufficient reason exists [[To]] 
require your disqualification [[From]] the prosecution of these cases." In short, Reiter told 
the county's top prosecutor for the past 13 years that he ought [[To]] get off the case. "It 
looks like a departure [[From]] professionalism," [[Miami]]-Dade State Attorney Katherine 
Fernandez Rundle said of Reiter's letter. 
Following [[Epstein]]'s indictment, Reiter referred the case [[To]] the [[Fbi]] [[To]] determine whether 
the super[[-]]rich, super[[-]]connected defendant had violated any federal laws. Reiter won't 
discuss the case or the broadsides aimed at him. But others almost uniformly use one 
word [[To]] describe the chief: professional. 
"[[I]] have always been impressed by Mike's professionalism and his leadership," said Rick 
Lincoln, chief of the Lantana Police Department and a Palm Beach County cop for 32 
years. "The town of Palm Beach has a very professional police department. We all 
consider Mike [[To]] be our peer and a man of integrity." Juno Beach Police Chief H.C. 
Clark [[Ii]] agreed. Although he doesn't know Reiter well, he has met with him on 
countywide law enforcement issues. "[[I]]'ve never seen him lose his cool. [[I]]'ve never seen 
anything but a professional demeanor [[From]] him." 
Reiter joined the Palm Beach Police Department in 1981, leaving a $20,000[[-]]a[[-]]year patrol 
job at the University of Pittsburgh. His personnel jacket shows consistently excellent job 
evaluations. Posh Palm Beach is no hotbed of crime, and in his first year on the job, a 
resident confined [[To]] his home with a sick child thanked Reiter for delivering a few Cokes 
[[To]] the house. Reiter refused payment for the beverages. Another resident thanked Reiter 
for shutting off his car's headlights in his driveway, saying a valet must have been at 
fault. Reiter worked everything [[From]] road patrol [[To]] organized crime, vice and narcotics. 
And he's no novice at investigations involving the island's rich and famous. He was the 
lead detective probing the drug overdose death of [[David]] Kennedy in 1984. He also was 
one of the officers who worked the investigation of William Kennedy Smith, who was 
charged in 1991 — and later acquitted — with raping a woman at the Kennedy family 
compound in Palm Beach. 
Reiter, who has a master's degree in human resource development [[From]] Palm Beach 
Atlantic University, also has attended the [[Fbi]] National Academy in Quantico, Va., and 
management courses at Harvard. He's been active in countywide interagency law 
enforcement organizations and has a "top secret" national security clearance. 
"He has a perspective that's broader than just addressing the needs of the town," said 
Town Manager Peter 
Elwell, who promoted Reiter [[From]] assistant chief [[To]] chief in March 2001. Reiter makes 
more than $144,000 as the town's top cop. Elwell thinks he's worth it. He's very 
businesslike, very straightforward. He's not easily agitated or flamboyant. He's about the 
work," Elwell said. "[[I]] think that his service as chief has been outstanding in five[[-]]plus 
years."

Questions of Preferential Treatment Are Raised in Sex Case Against Money Manager - 
September 3, 2006 
By ABBY GOODNOUGH 
PALM BEACH, Fla. — In the summer and autumn of last year, when most of the 
mansions here stood empty behind their towering hedges, the police stealthily watched 
one at the end of a waterside lane. They monitored the comings and goings of its owner's 
private jet, subpoenaed his phone records and riffled through his trash. 
The owner was [[Jeffrey]] [[Epstein]], 53, an intensely private New York money manager with 
several billionaire clients. Months earlier, the stepmother of a 14[[-]]year[[-]]old girl told the 
Palm Beach police that a wealthy older man, whom the girl later identified as Mr. 
[[Epstein]], might have had inappropriate sexual contact with her. 
In sworn statements [[To]] the police, the 14[[-]]year[[-]]old and other teenage [[Girls]] said a friend 
had arranged for them [[To]] visit Mr. [[Epstein]]'s home and give him massages, usually in 
their underwear, in exchange for cash. 
Most of the [[Girls]], according [[To]] the police, said Mr. [[Epstein]] had masturbated during the 
massages, and a few said he had penetrated them with his fingers or penis. They 
identified him in photos and accurately described the inside of his home. Some recalled 
that his employees had fed them snacks or rented them cars. 
Mr. [[Epstein]] pleaded not guilty in August [[To]] the crime he was ultimately charged with, 
soliciting prostitution. But at a time when prosecutors around the nation have become 
increasingly severe in dealing with people accused of sex offenses, the case has raised 
questions about whether Mr. [[Epstein]]'s prominence won him preferential treatment. 
By the account of the police, they found probable cause [[To]] charge Mr. [[Epstein]] with much 
more serious offenses: one count of lewd and lascivious molestation and four counts of 
unlawful sexual activity with a minor. 
But instead of proceeding with such charges on his own, the Palm Beach County state 
attorney took the rare step of presenting a broad range of possible charges [[To]] a grand jury, 
which indicted Mr. [[Epstein]] in July on the lesser count. In Florida, prosecutors usually 
refer only capital cases [[To]] grand juries. 
Even before the indictment, the Palm Beach police chief, [[Michael]] Reiter, had accused 
prosecutors of giving Mr. [[Epstein]] special treatment and asked the state attorney, Barry E. 
Krischer, [[To]] remove himself [[From]] the case. 
In an editorial, The Palm Beach Post attacked Mr. Krischer, a Democrat whose post is 
elective, saying the public had been left "[[To]] wonder whether the system tilted in favor of 
a wealthy, well[[-]]connected alleged perpetrator and against very young [[Girls]] who are 
alleged victims of sex crimes." 
The case has taken a toll on the reputation of Mr. [[Epstein]], who owns a palatial home in 
Manhattan, has pledged $30 million [[To]] Harvard and once flew former President Bill 
Clinton on his 727. Politicians including Eliot Spitzer, a Democratic candidate for 
governor in New York, and Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, also a Democrat, have 
returned campaign contributions [[From]] him. 
But Mr. [[Epstein]] fought back, assembling a team of star lawyers, including Gerald B. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030307 
Lefcourt and [[Alan]] M. Dershowitz, a friend of his, [[To]] look into the backgrounds of his 
young accusers. 
Mr. Lefcourt says that the police acted "outrageously" and that his client has been 
wrongfully dragged through the mud. 
"He disputes that he ever had sex with any under[[-]]age person or anything like that," said 
Mr. Lefcourt, whose clients have included Russell Crowe, Martha Stewart and Abbie 
Hoffman. 
Neither the police nor the state attorney's office would discuss the case in detail. But the 
police released a thick report on the 13[[-]]month investigation after the indictment was 
unsealed in late July. 
The police started investigating Mr. [[Epstein]] in March 2005, almost immediately after 
they were contacted by the stepmother of the 14[[-]]year[[-]]old, who, according [[To]] the report, 
was in a special school for students with disciplinary problems. 
The girl, the report said, told the police that an older friend had "offered her an 
opportunity [[To]] make money" and had driven her [[To]] Mr. [[Epstein]]'s house one Sunday. The 
friend, identified by the police as Haley Robson, a local community college student, told 
the girl [[To]] say she was 18 if Mr. [[Epstein]] asked, the report said. 
The girl told the police that Mr. [[Epstein]]'s assistant had led her upstairs [[To]] a room with a 
massage table and that Mr. [[Epstein]] had come in and told her [[To]] remove her clothes. She 
said Mr. [[Epstein]] had masturbated as she massaged him, had pressed a vibrator against her 
underwear and had given her $300 afterward. 
In October, the police interviewed Ms. Robson, then 19, who told them Mr. [[Epstein]] had 
routinely paid her [[To]] bring teenage [[Girls]] [[To]] his home. The police then interviewed a total 
of 5 alleged victims and 17 witnesses, many of whom told similar stories about what they 
had observed or participated in at Mr. [[Epstein]]'s home. According [[To]] the report, at least 
one said Mr. [[Epstein]] had engaged in intercourse with her. 
Mr. Lefcourt, his lawyer, said one girl who told the police of having had sex with Mr. 
[[Epstein]] as a minor had lied about both the sex and her age and had not shown up for 
grand jury questioning. He also said Mr. [[Epstein]] had passed a lie[[-]]detector test clearing 
him of any sexual involvement with under[[-]]age [[Girls]]. 
A spokeswoman for the Palm Beach police said that early this year, the police went [[To]] 
Mr. Krischer, the state attorney, intending [[To]] apply for warrants [[To]] arrest Mr. [[Epstein]]. 
Instead, she said, they were told that Mr. Krischer would convene a grand jury [[To]] 
examine the evidence and decide what charges, if any, [[To]] bring. 
Around that time, the police report said, Mr. Dershowitz met with prosecutors [[To]] share 
information about the accusers, including statements they had posted on MySpace.[[Com]], 
the social networking site, concerning use of drugs and alcohol. According [[To]] the report, 
Mr. Krischer's office then decided [[To]] delay the grand jury session for several months. 
The Palm Beach police grew frustrated, the report said, and on May [[1]] the department 
asked prosecutors [[To]] approve warrants [[To]] arrest Mr. [[Epstein]]. 
Chief Reiter also [[Wrote]] Mr. Krischer questioning "the unusual course that your office's 
handling of this matter has taken" and suggesting that Mr. Krischer disqualify himself. 
Chief Reiter refused several requests [[To]] be interviewed, and his spokeswoman would not 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030308 
say explicitly why he had urged the prosecutor [[To]] step aside. 
Mike Edmondson, a spokesman for Mr. Krischer, said the state attorney's office 
sometimes [[Sent]] noncapital cases [[To]] grand juries when there were questions about witness 
credibility. Mr. Krischer does not recommend a particular charge in such cases, Mr. 
Edmondson said, but gives the grand jury a list of possible charges. 
Bruce [[J]]. Winick, a law professor at the University of [[Miami]], said that while prosecutors 
in Florida rarely referred noncapital cases [[To]] grand juries, they sometimes did so with 
sensitive cases [[To]] be extra[[-]]cautious. 
Mr. Lefcourt said the police were wrong [[To]] have released the report so soon, especially 
without correcting information that later proved wrong. He cited his assertion that one 
accuser had lied about her age, adding that she had also been arrested on drug charges 
and had been fired by her employer for stealing. 
"What [[I]]'m trying [[To]] focus on," Mr. Lefcourt said, "is, What's motivating the selective 
and misleading release of information [[To]] the public?"

Financier Starts Sentence in Prostitution Case 
By [[Landon]] THOMAS Jr. 
The bad news arrived by phone last week on Little St. James Island, the palm[[-]]fringed 
Xanadu in the Caribbean where [[Jeffrey]] E. [[Epstein]], adviser [[To]] billionaires, lives in 
secluded splendor. 
Report [[To]] the Palm Beach County jail, the caller, Mr. [[Epstein]]'s lawyer, said. 
So over the weekend Mr. [[Epstein]] quit his pleasure dome, with its staff of 70 and its 
flamingo[[-]]stocked lagoon, and flew [[To]] Florida. On Monday morning, he turned himself in 
and began serving 18 months for soliciting prostitution. 
"[[I]] respect the legal process," Mr. [[Epstein]], 55, said by phone as he prepared [[To]] leave his
