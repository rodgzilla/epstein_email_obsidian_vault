Jeffrey, 
For taping in Cambridge? For breakfast and taping at my house. Depends on what woody is up for. My ideal 
would be a 1/2 hour-40 minute conversation, but we could do a quick taping in 15 minutes ...my team can be 
ready 
And , just to remind,could also come to do taping in ny on 24th because I'm coming to New York the evening 
of 23rd for a YIVO event--to which you would both be most welcome I'm sure (YIVO is the largest collection 
of materials from Jewish Eastern Europe)
