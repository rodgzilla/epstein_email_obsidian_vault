Hi Steve, 
I am still intrigued and would like to meet Michael. I thinks it makes sense, though, for us to have a more 
specific conversation about compensation before I meet with him. I don't want to put the cart before the horse, 
but as I mentioned, this would be a big move for me, and it would have to make sense economically in addition 
to being the right move for other reasons we have discussed. 
I hope you are well. Cannot believe that Christie endorsed Trump! 
Best, 
Kathy
