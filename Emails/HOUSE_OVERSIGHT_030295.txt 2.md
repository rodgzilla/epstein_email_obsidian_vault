All 
I am back on line now. 
I see the statement didn't go. Monday? Maybe tomorrow? 
> 
I will speak to Jeffery Epstein's lawyer but JE has a conflict with you and will want your silence as whilst you 
are being attacked there is less heat on him. 
Either is lying or not. If we let her lie without challenge then the lies become the reality and 
that may lead to you facing investigation. These are serious allegations and In the UK prosecuting people who 
face allegations of sex abuse is now common place and a lot of resources are focused on this. 
We can't sit back and let you be a conspirator by silence. 
Your are not guilty and must follow Dershowtiz line. He is a leading lawyer and he hasn't followed the don't say 
anything for fear of litigation. He has rightly called . bluff and shouted his innocence. 
You have to stand up and deny the allegations or be branded guilty by association and that may lead to other 
investigations and worse. 
I feel I am going around in circles. 
I know what is right to do and that is to shout your innocence. 
Try and get some rest. Call me tomorrow if you want anytime. 
Speak to Deshowitz. 
Don't allay yourself to JE as that is not the way to go. 
Best 
Philip
