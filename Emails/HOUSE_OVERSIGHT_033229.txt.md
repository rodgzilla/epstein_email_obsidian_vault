[[Jeffrey]] 
Pres. Trump arrives PBI Friday at 6pm is TFR is effective,. If we land before 6pm we are ok. 
Newark is not a gateway airport [[To]] PBI, only Teterboro„ 
If you want [[To]] arrive in PBI after 6pm,. [[I]] can relocate the GIV [[To]] Teterboro, 
What time do you estimate wheels up Friday [[From]] Newark? Or should [[I]] move plane [[To]] Teterboro Friday 
afternoon? 
Thx 
[[Larry]]
