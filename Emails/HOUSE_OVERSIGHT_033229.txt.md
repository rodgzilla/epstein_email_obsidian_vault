Jeffrey 
Pres. Trump arrives PBI Friday at 6pm is TFR is effective,. If we land before 6pm we are ok. 
Newark is not a gateway airport to PBI, only Teterboro„ 
If you want to arrive in PBI after 6pm,. I can relocate the GIV to Teterboro, 
What time do you estimate wheels up Friday from Newark? Or should I move plane to Teterboro Friday 
afternoon? 
Thx 
Larry
