Objet: RE: Revised letter. Arbitrary detention of Mr. Wade 
We have had some positive feedback from the article. Now the issue certainly has more visibility in Washington. Bob is 
in the process of setting up the meeting with Tom at the State Dept regarding the Human Rights Report for 2016. Will 
send more as we get more details.
