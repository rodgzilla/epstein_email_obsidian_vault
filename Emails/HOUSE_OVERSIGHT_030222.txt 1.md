Maz is the most devious and cunning of the bunch. However, Editors can pay for people, stories and documents. 
They can even pay criminals if it is in the public interest. 
Maz can pay who he wants for info but the Yorkshire Ripper for instance, as a convicted criminal, can't sell his 
story...unless in public interest cos there was say, a bent detective.

Witness payments in criminal trials 
i) No payment or offer of payment to a witness - or any person who 
may reasonably be expected to be called as a witness - should be made 
in any case once proceedings are active as defined by the Contempt of 
Court Act 1981. 
This prohibition lasts until the suspect has been freed 
unconditionally by police without charge or bail or the proceedings 
are otherwise discontinued; or has entered a guilty plea to the court; 
or, in the event of a not guilty plea, the court has announced its 
verdict. 
*ii) Where proceedings are not yet active but are likely and 
foreseeable, editors must not make or offer payment to any person who

may reasonably be expected to be called as a witness, unless the 
information concerned ought demonstrably to be published in the public 
interest and there is an over-riding need to make or promise payment 
for this to be done; and all reasonable steps have been taken to 
ensure no financial dealings influence the evidence those witnesses 
give. In no circumstances should such payment be conditional on the 
outcome of a trial. 
*iii) Any payment or offer of payment made to a person later cited to 
give evidence in proceedings must be disclosed to the prosecution and 
defence. The witness must be advised of this requirement.

*Payment to criminals 
i) Payment or offers of payment for stories, pictures or information, 
which seek to exploit a particular crime or to glorify or glamorise 
crime in general, must not be made directly or via agents to convicted 
or confessed criminals or to their associates — who may include 
family, friends and colleagues. 
ii) Editors invoking the public interest to justify payment or offers 
would need to demonstrate that there was good reason to believe the 
public interest would be served. If, despite payment, no public 
interest emerged, then the material should not be published.
