HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031475 
Lawyers for U.S.-based 
Turkish cleric fear 
attacks on his life 
WASHINGTON I BY JULIA HARTE 
Lawyers for U.S.-based Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen said on 
Friday they feared attacks on his life following Turkey's 
demands that he be extradited to face allegations that he 
ordered a failed coup against the government last month. 
The lawyers said they expected Gulen, who has denied any 
involvement in the July 15 coup attempt, will remain in his 
remote mountain compound in Pennsylvania. 
"We have read concerns from Turkey that Mr. Gulen, this 
elderly, frail religious leader, is going to flee to another country," 
said Steptoe & Johnson LLP attorney Reid Weingarten on 
Friday, calling such allegations "absurd." 
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has blamed Gulen for the 
violence, in which Erdogan said 237 people were killed 
excluding the plotters and more than 2,100 wounded, and said 
the United States should extradite him to Turkey. The U.S. 
government has not done so, and the dispute has raised 
questions about relations between the two allies. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031476 
Turkey, a member of the NATO alliance, hosts American troops 
and warplanes at Incirlik Air Base, an important staging area for 
the U.S.-led fight against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. 
At a news conference in Washington, Weingarten and Michael 
Miller, another Steptoe attorney, said evidence from a 2015 
case financed by the Turkish government against Gulen in U.S. 
federal court in Pennsylvania showed that the Turkish 
government relies on dubious proof to make its case against 
him. 
That case alleged Gulen issued coded orders to followers in the 
Turkish judiciary in a 2009 sermon to persecute members of 
another religious sect. It also alleged that the script of a popular 
Turkish television show was laced with follow-up messages. 
The case was dismissed by a judge in June. 
Turkish government officials, however, say such evidence is 
valid because Gulen operates covertly and sends encoded 
messages to his followers. 
Turkey has sent the United States new documents in recent 
days containing evidence that Turkish authorities say proves the 
cleric was behind the attempted coup. U.S. officials say they are 
looking through them.
