Beach
 Additional capital and operational costs to Town of
Palm Beach

WHY LOOK TO THE OCEAN?
 Sustainable drought-proof source of
water
 Concern for availability of fresh
surface water and groundwater
resources = regulatory pressure
 Decreasing costs due to technology
improvements
 Comparable costs to indirect potable
water reuse projects

TAMPA BAY DESALINATION FACILITY

PRE-TREATMENT IS KEY TO SUCCESS
 Protect the Membranes
 Screens remove shells,
creatures, wood and debris
greater than ¼ inch
 Heavier solids settled out via
flocculation and clarification
 Smaller solids filtered via
microfiltration membranes
 Ultraviolet light controls biological
activity and fouling
 Control scale formation by
adjusting pH and using
antiscalants
Fine screens
Clarification Basin
UV units

SPECIALIZED MEMBRANES FOR TREATMENT
 RO membranes allow water
particles (dissolved ions) to pass
through tiny screens, while
blocking salts
 Highly specialized technology
 Large amounts of power required
to “push” water through the
membranes via pressure
 Pre-treatment important to
protect costly membranes

SOLIDS HANDLING REQUIRED
Desalination produces “waste” streams that require
materials to be disposed via landfill.
 Debris removed by screens
(shells, wood, etc) must be
landfilled
 Clarification process &
microfiltration backwash solids
are thickened, dewatered, and
sent to the landfill for disposal
Transportation of solids increase facility operations cost
and result with a larger carbon footprint.
t

DESALINATION PLANT LAYOUT
DESALINATION PLANT ISSUES
 25 mgd facility required to produce 10 mgd potable water.
 Approximately 10 acres required ed for infrastructure.
 Complex treatment processes.
 Brine by-product waste disposal via deep injection well
(ocean outfalls no longer permitted for WTPs).
 Dewatered sludge must be disposed at landfill.
 Highly energy intensive to operate.

 Not necessarily exempt from proposed year-round water
restrictions drafted by SFWMD

FLORIDAN AQUIFER WATER PLANT OPTION
City Dedicates Floridan Plant for Town of Palm Beach
 Town remains a customer of the City of West Palm
Beach
 Additional capital and operational costs to Town of
Palm Beach
 Low Pressure Reverse Osmosis plant located on City
property
secure
reliable
sustainable

WHY LOOK TO THE FLORIDAN AQUIFER?
 Reliable and drought-proof source
located approximately 1,200 feet
below ground surface
 Relatively stable water quality
seasonally, but geographically
variable
 Reduces demands on water for the
Everglades
 Significantly less energy intensive
than desalination processes
 Landfill transportation and disposal
costs not applicable

TREATMENT PROCESSES
 SOURCE
SOURCE - wells can be located near the plant. No
existing users to cause interference (today).
 PRE-TREATMENT
TREATMENT- disposable 5 micron cartridge
filters, pH adjustment, & scale inhibitor.
 MEMBRANES
MEMBRANES – Low Pressure Reverse Osmosis
elements require less power to push water thru screens.
 POST-TREATMENT
TREATMENT – hydrogen sulfide removal with
odor control, disinfection, pH adjustment, blending.
 DISTRIBUTION – connect to existing water main
network without subaqueous crossings.

FLORIDAN PLANT LAYOUT
LOCATION
The Floridan Aquifer wells are not restricted with respect
to specific location in that no other production wells exists
today near the City’s WTP.

FLORIDAN AQUIFER PLANT ISSUES
 Floridan Aquifers can be used for both Aquifer Storage
and Recovery and source water
 Potential increased energy costs associated with lifting i
water and impacts to adjacent users
 Potential for decline in water quality over time
~Some pumping wells become saltier (up-coning of
more saline water from below or laterally along coast)
~ Membrane design and periodic replacement
~Blending with Surficial Aquifer water
 Estimated 125% of raw water to meet treated water
demands
 Concentrate disposal via deep injection well
