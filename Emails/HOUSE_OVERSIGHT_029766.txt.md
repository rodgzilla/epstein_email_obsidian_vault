According [[To]] Friday's NY Post [[Jeffrey]] [[Epstein]] returned [[To]] New York City "making wisecracks about his just-
ended jail stint for having sex with an underage girl". "[[I]]'m not a sexual predator, [[I]]'m an 'offender, ' " the Wall 
Street hedge fund manager told The Post. "It's the difference between a murderer and a person who steals a 
bagel," said [[Epstein]]. 
Well that's not [[Exactly]] the correct analogy... 
Not only are [[Epstein]]'s comments brazen, they are arrogant and self[[-]]implicating. By telling a reporter "[[I]]'m an 
offender", he seems [[To]] be admitting guilt. 
Which brings me [[To]] the big question of the day. Why did Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan D.A., allow a Level 
3 sex offender (the most dangerous kind) [[To]] reside -- even for ten minutes -- in a house that is right next [[To]] 
Central Park and a school? Isn't that unlawful given the housing guidelines for sex offenders? 
According [[To]] the NYPost, [[Epstein]]'s Level 3 designation means that he is at "high risk" [[To]] repeat his offense and 
poses "a threat [[To]] public safety." 
When [[I]] rang Vance (twice) [[To]] discuss [[Epstein]]'s residential guidelines he did not take my calls. 
According [[To]] a few of the attorneys who represented [[Epstein]]'s victims in the civil cases, the financier never 
agreed [[To]] a psychological evaluation prior [[To]] or during his sentence, a requirement of all sexual predators. 
While [[Epstein]]'s self[[-]]incriminating statements are published (this week he told the Post "the crime that was 
supposedly committed in Florida is not a crime in New York" -- an interesting choice of words -- he continues 
[[To]] mock the law that applies [[To]] all other sex offenders who are found guilty of the same crime. 
[[Epstein]] served 13 months in the West Palm Beach Stockade and 18 months under community control (a rather 
permissive version of house arrest), for 2 Counts of Solicitation of Prostitution with a Minor. 
In August of 2010, immediately following his release [[From]] "community control", [[Epstein]] returned [[To]] his $50 
million East 71st Street town house given [[To]] him by his former client and long time friend Leslie Wexner. 
Just in the last few weeks he held a house warming dinner [[To]] celebrate his release [[From]] jail and reportedly 
invited television reporters Katie Couric, Charlie Rose, George Stephanopoulus and his close friend, HRH 
Prince Andrew, according [[To]] the NY Post. 
You would think these professional television reporters would have done their homework prior [[To]] accepting his 
invitation no matter how desperate they were [[To]] rub elbows with Prince Andrew. 
According [[To]] a 53[[-]]page sealed indictment [[Epstein]] was facing 10 years [[To]] life on multiple counts of statutory 
rape, and child sex trafficking. 
Court documents in that case claimed he routinely sought out [[Girls]] as young as 14 and paid them $200 [[To]] $[[1]],000 
for sexually explicit massages in his homes in Palm Beach, Fla., and Manhattan. 
In the New York sex[[-]]offender database, [[Epstein]] isn't registered under a zip code rather a "name search" option 
that does not list his New York address. 
The reason for this is because [[Epstein]]'s Upper East Side home is considered "temporary" and by NY state law, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029766 
he is required [[To]] provide only his permanent address [[To]] the database. 
[[Epstein]] is currently listed under his Florida home even though he is no longer a Florida resident either (after his 
arrest he immediately became a US VI resident), but then again who's keeping count? 
Once again these are mere technicalities when it comes [[To]] [[Epstein]]'s sexual predator case. The two most 
disturbing parts of this story are that this could easily happen again and that once again there will be no justice. 
Had [[Epstein]] been a caring benefactor contributing [[To]] society and these young girl's education and well being 
then the world would have judged him differently. 
What he has done instead is the exact opposite -- causing enormous damage [[To]] hundreds of underage [[Girls]] who 
could have been sponsored towards a better education. 
With respect [[To]] Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance, [[I]]'m confused by his decision [[To]] allow this sexual predator [[To]] live 
at his Fifth Avenue house all this time (since August 2010), given his rather tough stance on gun control as 
witnessed by his testimony in Friday's NYPost when asked about a Florida driver cleared in a Manhattan 
weapon's charge, "guns brought illegally into New York City" he said, " for any reason violate well established 
state laws and are a threat [[To]] our public safety". 
Then wouldn't a registered sex offender living 500 feet [[From]] a park (Central Park where young [[Girls]] 
congregate), and with resources [[To]] spare be an even more dangerous threat [[To]] society?

Newscom Hedge fund mogul and sex offender [[Jeffrey]] [[Epstein]], who went free this week, lived in a 
depraved world of thrice[[-]]daily massages, pornographic artwork, and hush money—that's only now 
being revealed. [[Conchita Sarnoff]] reports on the sordid details in part two of her exclusive exposé. Also: 
• Nude images of young [[Girls]] were scattered around the house and the bathroom soap was shaped like sex 
organs 
• Staff trolled for fresh recruits [[To]] make sure [[Epstein]] had two or three massage appointments each day 
• The house manager has been sentenced [[To]] a longer prison term than [[Epstein]]—for trying [[To]] sell notes 
regarding massage appointments 
• [[Epstein]] gave $[[1]] million [[To]] his friend [[Jean Luc Brunel]] when he was starting the modeling agency MC2 
• According [[To]] a former bookkeeper, young [[Girls]] were brought [[To]] the U.S. by MC2—often [[From]] Eastern 
Europe—then traveled on [[Epstein]]'s private jets 
[[Jeffrey]] [[Epstein]]'s loyal friends say that his prosecution was unduly harsh, rather than outrageously lenient. 
They insist that his sexual habits, although obsessive and unusual, were mostly legal and essentially harmless. 
As the police records attest, the [[Girls]] brought [[To]] El Brillo Way were routinely told they could "say no" at any 
time during a massage as [[Epstein]] escalated contact in a step[[-]]by[[-]]step assault that was remarkably similar in 
every victim's statement: First she would be asked [[To]] remove her shirt, then her pants. He would attempt [[To]] 
fondle her buttocks and breasts as he masturbated, then bring out a large vibrator. There was sometimes digital 
penetration, and the more willing [[Girls]] were lured into full[[-]]blown sexual relations with both [[Epstein]] and Nadia 
Marcinkova, who was referred [[To]] in press accounts and police reports as [[Epstein]]'s live[[-]]in "sex slave." 
A former bookkeeper in the [[Miami]] office, who also arranged visas for [[Girls]] traveling [[To]] the U.S., confirmed 
that MC2 [[Girls]] became frequent guests on [[Epstein]]'s private jets. 
It's true that some underage [[Girls]] may have lied about their age, and some came [[To]] the house voluntarily several 
times—although, according [[To]] Florida statutes, none of that has any bearing on the criminality of the contact, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029767 
particularly if the girl was 16 or younger. But what is particularly disturbing about this case—judging by 
arrangements at the Palm Beach house—is that [[Epstein]], a billionaire hedge[[-]]fund manager, organized his life 
around this sexual compulsion in an open and methodical way that suggests he felt he was beyond the law. 
• [[Conchita Sarnoff]]: [[Epstein]] Faces Sex Traffic Probe  
• Billionaire Pedophile Goes Free  
According [[To]] police who executed a search warrant, the house was decorated with large, framed photos of nude 
young [[Girls]], and similar images were found stashed in an armoire and on the computers seized at the house 
(although police found only bare cables where other computers had been). Some bathrooms were stocked with 
soap in the shape of sex organs, and various sex toys, such as a "twin torpedo" vibrator and creams and 
lubricants available at erotic specialty shops, were stowed near the massage tables set up in several rooms 
upstairs. 
[[Epstein]] also enlisted his staff in the predatory activity, and four—Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, [[Lesley Groff]], 
and Marcinkova—figured in the [[Fbi]] investigation. The Non Prosecution Agreement stipulated that they would 
not be charged. According [[To]] police reports and sworn statements in the civil suits, all four women, among their 
other duties, worked [[To]] ensure that an appointment book for twice- or thrice[[-]]daily "massages" was stocked with 
fresh recruits. Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late Czechoslovakian[[-]]born press baron [[Robert]] Maxwell, 
who was for many years [[Epstein]]'s live[[-]]in partner, also recruited young [[Girls]]. 
Since his 13[[-]]month sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor, [[Epstein]] has settled more than a dozen 
lawsuits brought by underage [[Girls]]. Seven victims reached a last[[-]]minute deal last week, days before a 
scheduled trial; each received well over $[[1]] million—an amount that will hardly dent [[Epstein]]'s $2 billion net 
worth. 
The victims told police they waited in the kitchen [[To]] be called upstairs for a massage, and the house chef often 
gave them a bite [[To]] eat. House manager Alfredo Rodriguez said in his sworn statement that a maid named 
Lupita, who was a devout Catholic, wept when she complained [[To]] him about cleaning up after the massage 
sessions, picking up soiled towels and putting away the sex toys. And she was upset that a photo of [[Epstein]] 
with the pope hung next [[To]] one of him with a young girl. 
Ironically, Rodriguez, who ran the house on El Brillo Way in 2004 and 2005, ended up being sentenced [[To]] more 
jail time than his boss as a result of the complex investigation into [[Epstein]]'s activities. He was fired, he says, 
for inadvertently drawing police attention [[To]] one of the [[Girls]] when she arrived at the house unannounced [[To]] 
collect money. He saw an unfamiliar "beater" in the driveway one evening and called 911. When he left 
[[Epstein]]'s employ, Rodriguez took away some notes and emails about massage appointments as "protection" 
against his own prosecution, and failed [[To]] produce them during the Palm Beach Police Department's initial 
investigation.

Unable [[To]] get work as a house manager elsewhere in South Florida, he says, Rodriguez later tried [[To]] sell this 
"golden nugget"—his term—for $50,000, [[To]] be used in the victims' civil suits. Unfortunately, he made the 
offer [[To]] an undercover cop, and was subsequently charged with "obstruction of official proceedings" for 
withholding information that could have advanced the criminal investigation of [[Epstein]]—which by that point 
had been settled in a plea deal. Rodriguez was sentenced [[To]] 18 months in federal prison ([[Epstein]] was allowed [[To]] 
serve 13 months in the Palm Beach county jail), and now awaits an additional sentence on Aug. 24 in federal 
court in [[Miami]] for transporting firearms, another deal he says he made [[To]] pay the bills after he lost his job. 
In a deposition given for the civil suits, Rodriguez testified that he was instructed [[To]] always have $2,000 in cash 
on hand, so that he could pay both the [[Girls]] who gave massages and recruiters such as Haley Robson who 
brought them [[To]] the house. He also testified that [[Epstein]] made large contributions [[To]] the Palm Beach Police 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029768 
Department, and in return was given PBPD baseball hats [[To]] put on the dashboard of his various cars [[To]] avoid 
being stopped or ticketed by local police. Retired Police Chief [[Michael]] Reiter, in his own deposition, 
acknowledged that, in addition [[To]] earlier donations [[To]] the police department (which are fairly common in well-
heeled Palm Beach), [[Epstein]] had recently given the department $100,000 for some sophisticated equipment. 
The police were still researching the purchase when [[Epstein]] came under suspicion, and Reiter ordered the 
money returned. (Guy Frostin, one of [[Epstein]]'s local attorneys, told police that [[Epstein]] also gave $100,000 [[To]] 
the Florida Ballet for massages, because he was "very passionate" about massages being "therapeutically and 
spiritually" beneficial. Yet victims told police they had no massage training.) 
Perhaps most disturbing, in terms of possible sex trafficking, was [[Epstein]]'s relationship with [[Jean Luc Brunel]], 
owner of the MC2 modeling agency. According [[To]] a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern 
District of Florida, an alleged victim said that [[Epstein]], Maxwell, Brunel, Rodriguez, and Marcinkova 
"deliberately engaged in a pattern of racketeering that involved luring minor children through MC2, mostly 
[[Girls]] under the age of 17, [[To]] engage in sexual play for money." (Which would amount [[To]] trafficking.) 
Brunel is a 50[[-]]plus French playboy who was formerly part owner of Karin, a Paris[[-]]based modeling agency. He 
lives in New York and South Beach, Florida, and owns 85 percent of MC2, which has offices in New York, 
[[Miami]], and Tel Aviv. (The remaining 15 percent is owned by his partner, Jeff Fuller.) Brunel has been 
observed as a house guest at [[Epstein]]'s Palm Beach home and may well have had contact with him also in New 
York, where [[Epstein]] owns a lavish home, and in Paris, where [[Epstein]] keeps an apartment on elegant Ave. Foch. 
CBS reporter Craig Pyes, who investigated Brunel for a 60 Minutes broadcast many years ago, is quoted in 
[[Michael]] Gross' book about the modeling industry, Model: The Ugly Business QfBeautiful Women. Pyes told 
the author that Brunel "ranks among the sleaziest people in the fashion industry. We're talking about a 
conveyor belt, not a casting couch. Hundreds of [[Girls]] were not only harassed but molested." Now The Daily 
Beast has learned that [[Epstein]] had made a $[[1]] million wire transfer [[To]] Brunel's offshore bank account in 
September 2004, just as he was setting up MC2. Whether this was a gift or a loan or a backdoor investment in 
the new venture is unknown. A French citizen who managed [[To]] avoid giving evidence in the [[Epstein]] 
investigation, Brunel declined [[To]] comment on any of this, as does Fuller. Asked in April of Brunel's activities, 
[[Epstein]] said "[[I]]'m 100 percent convinced that he doesn't traffic children." (Brunel has never been charged.) 
An American fashion designer who booked her [[Girls]] through MC2 says they were very young and very 
beautiful; many were [[From]] Eastern Europe and spoke little English. A former bookkeeper in the agency's 
[[Miami]] office, who also arranged visas for [[Girls]] traveling [[To]] the U.S., confirmed that MC2 [[Girls]] became 
frequent guests on [[Epstein]]'s private jets. 
Pilot logs obtained in the civil suits show that some of the named plaintiffs were on the flight manifests. Other 
times, the pilot would just list the other passengers plus "female."

[[Jeffrey]] [[Epstein]], Jew Billionaire Pedophile, Child Trafficker Goes Free[[-]]WoW! 20 year old Hearsay is enough [[To]] destroy catholic priest. What happened here [[To]] the justice 
system? 
[[Conchita Sarnoff]] 
http://www.thedailyb...hile-  goes-free/ 
[[Conchita Sarnoff]] has developed multimedia communication programs for Fortune 500 companies and has 
produced three current events debate television programs, The Americas Forum, [[From]] Beirut [[To]] Kabul, and a 
segment for The Oppenheimer Report. She is writing a book about child trafficking in America. 
Hedge fund mogul and sex offender [[Jeffrey]] [[Epstein]], who went free this week, lived in a depraved world of 
thrice[[-]]daily massages, pornographic artwork, and hush money—that's only now being revealed. Conchita 
Sarnoff follows up on her investigation of the legal wrangling that saved him [[From]] a long prison term and 
reports on the sordid details in part two of her exclusive exposé. Also: 
• Palm Beach's police chief objected [[To]] [[Epstein]]'s "special treatment" and gave The Daily Beast an exclusive 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029769 
look at his nine[[-]]hour deposition about the investigation. 
• Earlier versions of the U.S attorney's charges, including a sealed 53[[-]]page indictment, could have landed 
[[Epstein]] in prison for 20 years. 
• Victims alleged that [[Epstein]] molested underage [[Girls]] [[From]] South America, Europe, and the former Soviet 
republics, including three 12[[-]]year[[-]]old [[Girls]] brought over [[From]] France as a birthday gift. 
• The victims also alleged trips out of state and abroad on [[Epstein]]'s private jets, which would be evidence of 
sex trafficking—a much more serious federal crime than the state charges [[Epstein]] was convicted of 
• [[Epstein]]'s attorneys investigated members of the Palm Beach Police Department, while others ordered private 
investigators [[To]] follow and intimidate the victims' families; one even posed as a police officer. 
• Then[[-]]Attorney General Alberto Gonzales told The Daily Beast that he "would have instructed the Justice 
Department [[To]] pursue justice without making a political mess." 
Film director Roman Polanski is not the only convicted pedophile [[To]] walk free this month and return [[To]] a life of 
privilege. On Wednesday, hedge fund manager [[Jeffrey]] [[Epstein]] completes his one[[-]]year house arrest in Palm 
Beach, which has been even less arduous than Polanski's time at a Swiss ski chalet. 
Watch [[Jeffrey]] [[Epstein]] Storm Out of a Deposition When Asked About His Penis 
During [[Epstein]]'s term of "house arrest," he made several trips each month [[To]] his New York home and his 
private Caribbean island. In the earlier stage of his sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor[[-]]13 
months in the Palm Beach Stockade—he was allowed out [[To]] his office each day. Meanwhile, [[Epstein]] has settled 
more than a dozen lawsuits brought by the underage [[Girls]] who were recruited [[To]] perform "massages" at his 
Palm Beach mansion. Seven victims reached a last[[-]]minute deal last week, days before a scheduled trial; each 
received well over $[[1]] million—an amount that will hardly dent [[Epstein]]'s $2 billion net worth. 
• [[Conchita Sarnoff]]: [[Epstein]] Faces Sex Traffic Probe 
• The Billionaire Pedphile's Sex Den 
With that, the known victims of [[Epstein]]'s sexual compulsion have been officially silenced, and the case against 
him is closed unless new ones come forward. According [[To]] banking sources, he has been moving assets out of 
the U.S. and may well follow Polanski into a luxurious exile. 
But the question remains: Did [[Epstein]]'s wealth and social connections—former President Bill Clinton; Prince 
Andrew; former Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Barak]]; New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson; and former Treasury 
Secretary [[Larry]] [[Summers]] were just a few of the prominent passengers on his private jets—allow him [[To]] receive 
only a slap on the wrist for crimes that carry a mandatory 20[[-]]year sentence? Was he able, with his limitless 
assets and heavy[[-]]hitting lawyers—[[Alan]] Dershowitz, Gerald Lefcourt, [[Roy Black]], Kenneth [[Starr]], Guy Lewis, 
and Martin Weinberger among them—[[To]] escape equal justice? 
[[Epstein]] Faces Sex[[-]]Traffic Probe 
http://www.thedailyb...obref=obnetwork  
The Justice Department is investigating [[Jeffrey]] [[Epstein]] for child trafficking, The Daily Beast has learned—and 
has widened the scope of its probe [[To]] include a famous modeling agency. 
Hedge[[-]]fund manager [[Jeffrey]] [[Epstein]] completed his sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor last week. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029770 
But it appears his problems may not be over. Now The Daily Beast has learned that: 
• Federal investigators continue [[To]] investigate [[Epstein]]'s activities, [[To]] see whether there is evidence of child 
trafficking—a far more serious charge than the two in his non[[-]]prosecution agreement, the arrangement 
between [[Epstein]] and the Department of Justice allowing him [[To]] plead guilty [[To]] lower[[-]]level state crimes. 
Trafficking can carry a 20[[-]]year sentence. 
• The [[Fbi]] is also investigating [[Epstein]]'s friend [[Jean Luc Brunel]], whose MC2 modeling agency appears [[To]] have 
been a source of [[Girls]] [[From]] overseas who ended up on [[Epstein]]'s private jets. 
Because [[Epstein]]'s predatory habits stretch back many years and involved dozens of young[[-]]looking [[Girls]], there 
may well be more evidence [[To]] uncover. 
Under the concept of double jeopardy, [[Epstein]] can no longer be prosecuted for any of the charges covered by 
his non[[-]]prosecution agreement, in which he agreed [[To]] serve a short term of incarceration, fund the civil suits of 
named victims, and register as a sex offender. The victims who accepted cash settlements in these civil suits 
agreed not [[To]] testify against him or speak publicly about the case. However, new evidence developed by the 
Department of Justice on other offenses not covered by the agreement, including allegations by additional 
victims who come forward, could lead [[To]] new charges. There is no statute of limitations in the federal sex-
trafficking law, which was also enacted by the state of Florida in 2002. Because his predatory habits stretch 
back many years and involved dozens of young[[-]]looking [[Girls]], there may well be more evidence [[To]] uncover. 
(Several young women who claim [[To]] be [[Epstein]] victims have recently contacted a Ft. Lauderdale lawyer, but [[To]] 
[[Date]] no new civil complaints have been filed.) 
• [[Conchita Sarnoff]]: The Billionaire Pedphile's Sex Den 
• Billionaire Pedophile Goes Free 
These new developments come one week after the publication of two articles in The Daily Beast about 
[[Epstein]]'s pattern of sexual contact with underage [[Girls]], which Palm Beach police began investigating in 2005 
and the U.S. Attorney's office then settled in a 2007 plea deal. The first article quoted a deposition by then-
Palm Beach Chief of Police [[Michael]] Reiter, in which he stated that [[Epstein]], a billionaire with many powerful 
friends, had received special treatment in both his plea deal and the terms of his incarceration. Although federal 
investigators at one point produced a draft 53[[-]]page indictment against [[Epstein]], he was eventually allowed [[To]] 
plead guilty [[To]] only two relatively minor state charges and receive a short term of incarceration: 13 months in 
the county jail, during which he went [[To]] the office every day, and one year of community control, during which 
he traveled frequently [[To]] New York and his private island in the Virgin Islands. 
The Daily Beast has now discovered another instance in which [[Epstein]] apparently received special 
consideration: As a convicted sex offender, he is required by law [[To]] undergo an impartial psychological 
evaluation prior [[To]] sentencing and [[To]] receive psychiatric treatment during and after incarceration. This is 
because child molesters tend [[To]] be repeat offenders with high rates of recidivism. According [[To]] a source in law 
enforcement, however, [[Epstein]] was allowed [[To]] submit a report by his private psychologist, Dr. Stephen 
Alexander of Palm Beach, Florida, whose phone has since been disconnected with no forwarding information. 
The Daily Beast's second article provided details about [[Epstein]]'s systematic abuse of underage [[Girls]] at his 
Palm Beach mansion, where members of his staff allegedly recruited and paid a parade of teenagers, most of 
them 16 or younger, [[To]] perform daily massages that devolved into masturbation, groping, and sometimes full-
blown sexual contact. It also revealed a monetary relationship between [[Epstein]] and [[Jean Luc Brunel]], a frequent 
visitor [[To]] whom he gave $[[1]] million around the same time that Brunel was starting his MC2 modeling agency. 
Some of the young [[Girls]] MC2 recruited [[From]] overseas—often [[From]] Eastern Europe and South America—are 
known [[To]] have been passengers on [[Epstein]]'s private jets. 
The U.S. Attorney General's Office in Florida says that it is against policy [[To]] confirm or deny the existence of 
an investigation. [[Jeffrey]] [[Epstein]]'s lawyer, [[Jack Goldberger]], says he has no knowledge of an ongoing probe, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029771 
and he told The Daily Beast, "[[Jeffrey]] [[Epstein]] has fully complied with all state and federal requirements that 
arise [[From]] the prior proceedings in Palm Beach. There are no pending civil lawsuits. There are not and should 
not be any pending criminal investigations, given Mr. [[Epstein]]'s complete fulfillment of all the terms of his non-
prosecution agreement with the federal government."
