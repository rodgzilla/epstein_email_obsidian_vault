[[I]] am writing a story about how markets keep ripping ahead despite political craziness. VIX so low, etc. 
You must get a lot of this in talking [[To]] clients -- people freaking out about headlines as markets hit 
new highs. How do you spin this [[To]] them? One hedgie Trump supporter told me that Trump is the 
highest beta prez ever -- ie the highs will be high but so will be the lows. 
Question: how closely does DJT track market moves? [[I]] know he tweets about Dow 20,000 but how 
aware do you think he is about how market really betting big on him. Does he talk [[To]] Barrack about 
this? Cohn?
