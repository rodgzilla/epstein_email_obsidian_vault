Hello Martin, 
Thank you for getting back to me. We would be looking for on record comments or a "no comment" to our 
questions. But I am certainly happy to have an off record conversation with yourself as well. Perhaps we 
could set up a time to chat briefly off record on Monday before I send you our questions for Mr Epstein? 
Kind regards, 
Matt
