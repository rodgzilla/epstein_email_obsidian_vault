Underweight positioning, buybacks resuming, positive momentum and strong fundamentals all indicate that there is still 
further upside potential in financials (more details below). Our financials sector specialist thinks XLF could have another 
20-25% upside given the many levers to the Trump Trade: less regulation, higher interest rates, higher vol, economic 
growth, loan growth, etc. The asset sensitive regional banks are more of a pure play on a rates move but we view the 
larger cap banks as having multi-pronged upside given the aforementioned points. 
That said, given the velocity and magnitude of the recent move and uncertainty around the impact and timing of 
Trump's policies, we believe options offer better risk-reward than being outright long financials stocks here. With flat 
call skew, "appearing" call spreads with upside knock-ins price well. 
Buy a 1 year XLF call spread for 2.6% premium 
• Buy a 110% call 
• Sell a 117.5% call with an at-expiry knock-in at 125% (call is not active unless XLF is 125% or higher at expiry) 
o Total premium is 2.6% 
o Gross max payoff if knock-in is triggered: 2.9x (7.5%/2.6%) 
o Gross max payoff if knock-in is not triggered: 5.7x (14.9%/2.6%) — you have upside up to 124.9%

• US Buyback Flows 
• Cons Disc, Technology and Financials are the largest 3 sectors for US buybacks (over 70% of execution). We 
are seeing a seasonal increase in buybacks as we come out of the low seasonal month of the year (October) and should 
see increased buyback executions until year-end, another source of upside for the Cons Disc, Technology and Financials  
sectors.  
Global Positioning, Nigel Tupper, 11/14. Large long-only funds are more underweight Financials than any other 
sector and are UW this sector in all regions.

raising our price objectives across most of our names. Three primary reasons why we think there is upside remaining

after the recent rally: 1) an improved outlook on both activity levels and interest rates, driving revenue upside; 2) 
potentially lower regulatory burden, particularly as new supervisory leadership can come with the new administration; 
and 3) relatively lighter positioning in US financials vs. other sectors. (Erika Najarian)
