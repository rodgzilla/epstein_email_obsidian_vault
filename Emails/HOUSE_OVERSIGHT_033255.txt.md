Hi [[Jeffrey]], [[I]] was happy [[To]] meet you this morning. 
person) 
You asked [[To]] see some things [[I]]'ve written. Here's my (only slightly out of [[Date]]) professional web presence, including 
Letterman clip: 
www.thedylanlove.com  
Here are a few stories [[I]]'ve written more recently that are not displayed on my site:

You might get a special kick out of this Trump story:

What kinds of media goals/story ideas are interesting [[To]] you? Masha has made it clear that she wants me [[To]] write 
something about you, but that's much more your call [[To]] make. [[I]] suggest that there is mileage [[To]] be gained by quoting you 
in a story about how proper implementation of cryptocurrency might solve financial corruption issues. 
[[I]] travel back [[To]] Austin, Texas tomorrow evening, but am of course reachable. Thanks again for your time this morning.
