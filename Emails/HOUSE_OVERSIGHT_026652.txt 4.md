Arrested in Inauguration Day Riot, Raising Questions 
Hi Kathy and Stuart, 
You may have already seen this article, but sharing it just in case you haven't. Please let us know if we can be 
of any help coordinating with the client's PR firm, which Stuart mentioned that you were doing yesterday. 
According to Wikipedia, "Heat Street is a libertarian conservative news, opinion and commentary website. 
Launched in February 2016, the website is headed by U.S. based British writer and former politician Louise 
Mensch. It is owned by News Corp under Dow Jones & Company." 
Thanks,

'Shady' Israeli Mogul Hires Ex-White House Counsel To Represent Employee Arrested in Inauguration Day 
Riot, Raising Questions<http://heatst.com/politics/shady-israeli-mogul-hires-ex-white-house-counsel-to-
represent-employee-arrested-in-inauguration-day-riot-raising-questions/>

The mystery surrounding a would-be media magnate — who owns surveillance and security firms working for 
repressive regimes — is growing. 
The questions about Matania (Mati) Kochavi were sparked again this weekend when Kathryn Ruemmler, who 
until recently was President Obama's White House Counsel, showed up on Saturday morning in local 
Washington DC court to represent one of the 217 people arrested for rioting on Inauguration Day. 
[http://heatst.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ruemmler-obamajpg?w=300]Kathryn Ruemmler and client. 
Ms. Ruemmler said she was there to represent a journalist, on assignment for the media company 
Vocativ<http://www.vocativ.com/>, who'd gotten swept up with the protesters in the arrests. 
Vocativ is owned by Kochavi. Reporters at the courthouse asked why a big gun like Ruemmler, who has long 
been a specialist in corporate crime, would show up for what would seem to be a misunderstanding involving a 
journalist doing his job. 
Ms. Ruemmler told Buzzfeed that Vocativ is a client of her 
firm,<http s ://www.buzz feed. co m/zo etillman/pro s ecutors-pursue-rioting- charges- over-inauguration- day-
pro?utm term=.gtPej4zonti.cgyzaBvG2> Latham & Watkins. The firm is one of the most prestigious law shops 
in New York and Washington with partners such as Ruemmler<https://www.lw.com/people/kathrynruemmler> 
charging thousands of dollars an hour. 
She did look somewhat out of place among the lawyers there to defend anarchists and other alleged 
troublemakers who are charged with rioting, burning a limo and smashing up stores on the streets of the capital. 
"The individuals charged were generally brought in front of the judge in groups of 10 and were represented by a 
cadre of public defenders and other court-appointed lawyers," according to Buzzfeed. That was not the case 
when it came to Vocativ. 
Based in New York and Tel Aviv, Vocativ publishes mostly reprints of health studies, aggregated videos for 
Facebook, and female focused feature pieces. The company which employs a large team of US journalists and 
ex-Israeli intelligence operatives, claims to use technology from the intelligence world to source its stories. 
Indeed its founder, Kochavi, has a background in Israeli intelligence, having made his fortune providing 
security and military grade public safety solutions to the superrich Emirate of Abu Dhabi through an entity 
called AGT.

HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026653 
Dhabi 
AGT was responsible for installing a "unique civil surveillance network in Abu Dhabi that means 'every person 
is monitored from the moment they leave their doorstep to the moment they return to it,' according to the noted 
security publication MiddleEastEye.<http ://www.middleeasteye.net/news/uae-israel-surveillance-2104952769> 
The invasive system is dubbed "Falcon Eye". 
Kochavi also owns Israeli security and private intelligence firms 3iMind and Logic Industries. Like Vocativ, 
3iMind claims to use "the deep web" to mine information, though in 3iMind's case it provides spy services, not 
journalistic ones. 3iMind even advertises online that it will spy on "the planning and execution of violent civil 
unrest" for clients.<https://www.3i-mind.com/use cases/political-social-unrest/> 
The website for Kochavi's mother company<https://www.agtinternational.com/about/>, AGT, claims its current 
business is using "Internet of Things" technology for entertainment and "fashion" applications in partnership 
with the giant talent agency WME-IMG ... though it's unclear what any of these applications really 
are<http://www.euroleague.net/final-four/berlin-2016/news/i/6vokoibj5fsgqg4q/heed-the-event-platform-based-
joint-venture-between-wme-img-and-agt-international-makes-first-official-foray-into-sports>, and certainly 
what value they provide for entertainment. Security experts say Internet of Things type sensors could be tied 
together to monitor crowds for security purposes. 
According to Israeli and U.S. Jewish publications, the lines within Kochavi's companies can blur, with Vocativ 
employees doing work for 3iMind and Logic, and vice versa. So who was this "journalist" arrested amid the 
unrest on Inauguration Day? Was he actually doing journalism? Or, as some journalists around town have been 
asking, could he also have been doing surveillance of anti-Trump demonstrators on behalf of an Arab or Israeli 
client, possibly a foreign government?

A call to Ruemmler was returned by someone identifying himself as a Vocativ spokesperson. He told Heat 
Street that the arrested employee, Evan Engel, was doing purely journalistic work at the time he was detained. 
"The arrest, detainment and rioting charge against journalist Evan Engel who was covering the protests for 
Vocativ are an affront to the First Amendment and journalistic freedom," the spokesperson said. "Vocativ will 
vigorously contest this unfounded and outrageous charge." 
Kochavi has taken pains to put a different face, unrelated to spying and surveillance, on his American activities. 
Vocativ acts like a news organization, though it's made little splash (and gets remarkably little web 
traffic<http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/vocativ.com>) for an operation so large and expensive. 
Kochavi has also shown little hesitation to pay top dollar for access to the most powerful figures in America to 
provide legitimacy for his American activities. Last fall's Wikipedia data dump revealed that he and his 
longtime business partner, New York rainmaking lawyer Mary Edelman, offered Bill Clinton millions of dollars 
to serve as honorary chairman of the company that would become Vocativ. <http://heatst.com/biz/wikileaks-
bill-clinton-turned-down-8-million-to-be-honorary-chairman-of-news-site-vocativ/> Clinton turned them down, 
perhaps nervous about Kochavi who's been described as "a mysterious even somewhat shady character" and the 
Israeli "version of the old-fashioned arms dealer with a suit and an MBA" by the progressive Jewish blog 
Tikkun Olam.<https://www.richardsilverstein.com/2014/12/04/israeli-cyber-security-merchant-peddles-wares-

And now Kochavi has purchased the services of President Obama's former White House counsel, Ruemmler, 
whose name was once on the shortlist<http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-ruemmler-attorney-general-nixed-
20141024-story.html> for US attorney general. It's a fair question to ask: why was Ruemmler really down in 
local DC court on a Saturday morning? Why was getting this Vocativ employee off the hook such a high 
priority? And what, if any, other services has Ruemmler, the corporate crime expert, been providing to Kochavi 
and his various intelligence operations around the world? 
Ruemmler herself has not returned requests for comment.
