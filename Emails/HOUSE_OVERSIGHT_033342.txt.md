spoke [[To]] TSA at Palm Bch Atlantic, 
Once the President departs Palm Beach area, the TFR (temporary flight restriction) is lifted, 
we should be able [[To]] land in RBI., 
currently the TFR expires at 10:30pm„ the superbowl is typically 3 hours long, it starts at 6:30pm„ 
Only a guess, Trump will leave around 10pm is my guess.
