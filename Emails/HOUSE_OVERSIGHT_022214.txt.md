Apparently Brazil is a hot investment place now (?) It is more about the offset part than the jet deal. France, Sweden and 
USA are all lobbying to get the jet deal as aviation is tied into potentially big tourism deals. (36 planes) 
I was just on a call with a guy in Sweden who is dealing with this... 
I never know if the stories are real, but he claims to work with the Brazilian president, Obama, Warren Buffet etc..
