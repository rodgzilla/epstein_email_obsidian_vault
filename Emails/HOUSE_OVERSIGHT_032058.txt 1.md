[[I]]'m a reporter at CNN, and my colleague Blake Ellis and [[I]] have read that Bill Clinton and Donald 
Trump have both visited [[Epstein]]'s private island. We are trying [[To]] determine whether there is any 
truth [[To]] the allegations that either or both of these men may have had sexual relations with minors 
while there. We know that you have been [[Epstein]]'s pilot, so we're wondering if you would be willing 
[[To]] speak with us completely off the record. We are not focusing on the allegations against [[Epstein]] --
we are solely focusing on Trump and Clinton given the current allegations being levied in the press. 
If you don't feel comfortable sharing anything [[Via]] social media or email, feel free [[To]] send us any 
documentation/proof that might be helpful anonymously [[Via]] mail: 
Melanie Hicken 
You can also reach us by phone: 
Thanks so much, 
Melanie
