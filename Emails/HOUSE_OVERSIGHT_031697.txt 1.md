Dear Friend, 
Both Sides Now [[W]]/Huffington & Matalin celebrates its 1st anniversary this week. As the 
only 2 sides/2 women show on national radio, we've grown [[From]] 16 stations in May of 
2010 [[To]] 110 now. 
Arianna and Mary find consensus that, contrary [[To]] the Washington and media 
conventional wisdom, the Jobs Agenda is more urgent than the Deficit Agenda ("if people 
only read about shark attacks, they'll worry about shark attacks," says Arianna). And they 
agree that there's an apparent outbreak of men abusing the help -- Strauss[[-]]Kahn, 
Schwarzenegger, Ensign. [[To]] paraphase Freud, what do men want? 
But there's sharp disagreement about whether Rep. Ryan walked into Obama's trap by 
proposing [[To]] end Medicare in 10 years. Will the special election this Tuesday in Jack 
Kemp's old seat produce a Democratic "Scott Brown Moment"? 
[[To]] read the show summary and listen, http://www.huffindtonpost.com/huff-radio/both-

Best,
