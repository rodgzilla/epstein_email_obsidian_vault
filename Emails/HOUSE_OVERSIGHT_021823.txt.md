Ha, the sequel comment is great. But I don't think it's my place to discuss her accusations of other people...I know nothing about it and never met her or Clinton. 
The points I can legitimately address are the nature of my involvement with you and some smoking gun allegations by the other girls. I will talk to a lawyer this

It could really be fun if I made a viral video that showed how easily people can be fooled, followed by a statement saying the stories are obviously false. If it's fun, 
tabloids may cover it... 
Btw, I was invited to go to Davos...does not seem like such a good idea at the moment
