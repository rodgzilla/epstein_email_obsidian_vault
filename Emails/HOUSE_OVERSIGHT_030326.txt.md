Congressional candidate compares Melania 
Trump [[To]] prostitute 
By Chris Perez 
A congressional candidate [[From]] Oregon has caused an uproar on social media after 
comparing first lady Melania Trump [[To]] a prostitute. 
"Did you know the First Lady works by the hour?" tweeted independent House candidate  
Mark Roberts on Monday, using the hashtags "#thinkdirty" and "#hoebag." 
Twitter users were quick [[To]] blast the politician for his crude comment, with some calling on 
him [[To]] pull out of the 2nd Congressional District race for Republican incumbent [[Greg]] 
Walden's seat. 
"Very unprofessional on your part," tweeted one person. "Grow up and stick [[To]] the issues, so 
the voters in your district can decide on your stand regarding the issues." 
Another added, "Wow no class Mark. You're definitely using liberal tactics and it makes me 
wonder if you really are a conservative at all." 
Roberts sparked the social media storm on Monday afternoon after replying [[To]] a tweet [[From]] 
Charlie Kirk, president of the right[[-]]wing youth organization Turning Point USA. Kirk had 
compared Melania's staff numbers [[To]] those of former first lady Michelle Obama. 
"Did you know: There are thirty[[-]]nine fewer staffers dedicated [[To]] The First Lady of the 
United States (FLOTUS) than under Obama," Kirk tweeted, referencing data reported in 
January. 
"There are only five staffers dedicated [[To]] Melania Trump vs. forty[[-]]four staffers who served 
Michelle Obama," he said.

Political experts told The Oregonian on Tuesday that Roberts' reply completely railroaded 
his chances of unseating Walden in a race that was already said [[To]] be a longshot. 
"If he wins, [[I]]'ll sell my house and donate [[To]] charity," joked Jim Moore, political science 
professor at Pacific University. 
Roberts is apparently known for making crude and outlandish remarks on Twitter, most of 
which have been aimed at politicians. 
"#NikkiHaley very hot," he once tweeted, in reference [[To]] a TV appearance she made last 
year. 
"Important stuff," Roberts added. 
Describing Illinois Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris, the independent candidate tweeted: 
"Hot, tough & smart!" 
Commenting on a video featuring President Trump, he said: "It looks like he's morphing 
into a woman, get that man a haircut and non fat chocolate cake!" 
In response [[To]] the social media backlash he's been receiving, Roberts refused [[To]] apologize 
and instead cited the Constitution. 
"It's that whole 1st amendment thing," he tweeted on Tuesday, along with an official 
explanation [[From]] Twitter as [[To]] why his tweet about Melania hasn't been taken down. 
"We have investigated the reported content and could not identify any violations," a 
spokesperson said. "Accordingly, we have not taken any action at this time."
