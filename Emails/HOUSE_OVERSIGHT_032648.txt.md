Shouldn't be [[To]] bad if we are leaving early and Trump is not scheduled [[To]] depart until 3pm on Sunday, the 
Departure will be similar [[To]] a DCA Departure with Customs, 
TSA will have an office set up inside the FBO, you will enter the main lobby at Atlantic and be escorted [[To]] the 
plane after you meet with TSA officers., 
[[I]] have [[To]] schedule all passengers names 24hours in advance, no additions within 24 Hours, 
Thx
