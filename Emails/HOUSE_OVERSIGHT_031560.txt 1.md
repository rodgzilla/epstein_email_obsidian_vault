we're on the same team. strzok. testimony was that discussions with lovers , often include embellishments, and not 
indicative of non professionalism. I believe he said nothing more than it referenced " andys office". . says andy 
was there. how many other people were there ? were strzok and . off in the corner talking to each other. was 
mccabe on the phone? you know that taking emails alone is not meaningful. . isnt it a but much to say that 
prosecutors that have strong opinions . should be looked out with skepticism? who doesnt have bias. . strzok had 
many neg hillary opinions .. - michael cohen. michael flynn.. are not fictions created by mueller ? how are you ?

Gotti was an anomaly because of his personality (some agents loved him and some hated him); but I get your 
point. Couple of things: 
1. This the investigation of the President. It is only as good as public confidence in it can be (subtracting the conspiracy 
theorists on both sides). We just can't have someone with this kind of political bias as a lead investigator. But more 
importantly, he was not alone. He was just stupid enough to show it in office emails. We don't yet know what his private 
emails showed. Strzok, however, says that he met with McCabe - the number 2 guy in the FBI - and in his office 
discussed how best to stop Trump from becoming President. That just cannot be tolerated. Plus, if I find any evidence 
of personal or other extraneous animus in any case by any agent or prosecutor, I view it as an open invitation for cross 
examination and any other exploitation possible as it cannot be an accepted part of the process. 
2. In this whole matter, I am most disturbed by the composition of the Mueller team and it seems to me that if we are to 
learn anything from the IG's report it is the importance of having an investigation conducted above-board without 
personal and political baggage. Mueller had a whole universe of lawyers from around the country to choose from to 
make up his team. He purposefully chose a murderer's row of the worst. I can go one by one; but I will spare you. Here 
are a couple of examples: 
A. Andrew Weissmann was known in the EDNY as "The Pathological Liar" after the SNL character. He literally would 
withhold exculpatory evidence throughout the case and then one day when defense counsel went to the bathroom or 
lunch, stick the documents under others on his table and tell the judge the lawyer had it all along. I have been brought 
into a case in which he lied from start to finish - and now his rats have come to me to admit their role in it - to get murder 
convictions in two cases. He has been cited by judges for his misconduct and he runined both Arthur Anderson and 
Enron through his work, all of which was rejected by the higher courts. He also is a Trump hater and Clinton 
sycophant. Mueller knows Weissmann's conduct up close and personal. He chose Weissmann for his chief counsel at 
the FBI years ago. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031560 
B. Jeannie Rhee, hand-picked by Mueller from Mueller's own firm, was actually Clinton's lawyer in the email 
investigation. Now how does that look. She also is a bully and thinks she is a real tough guy and I don't want that kind 
of character around. I also have an ineffective assistance of counsel case against her for a client in a $100 million 
earnings management fraud case in which she was way over her head. 
C. Greg Andres was another bully who replaced Weissmann in the EDNY. He withheld evidence terribly in his cases, 
regularly threatened others, and accused a defendant of putting out a contract on him when he knew it was a completely 
bogus claim, but gave him the publicity he craved. He is 100% in the pro-Clinton, anti-Trump camp. President Obama 
gave his wife a federal judgeship on the SDNY 
and on and on. 
I don't personally believe Russia affected the election at all; but I certainly am not qualified to say. I do know that we 
have meddled in other countries' elections as a matter of policy forever. But the bottom line is, if there is to be an 
investigation, just play it straight up. I am friends for a long time with the IG. If they had picked him to head up the team, 
I would not be a weekly guest on Hannity tv and radio (I never would have been asked), as I know he would pick a team 
of honest folks from across the spectrum.
