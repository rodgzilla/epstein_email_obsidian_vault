Brad — 
In your answers [[To]] ROGS, you list Milton Center for [[Girls]] as facility that Jane Doe attended. Milton Center is a 
Department of Juvenile Justice facility; therefore [[I]] will need [[To]] get her records [[From]] DJJ. DJJ will not release the records 
without a signed release by Jane Doe. [[I]] have attached a general HIPPA release for your review. Would you please have 
Jane Doe sign it? DJJ does not have a standard form. 
Also, will you agree [[To]] one more week on Responses [[To]] Net Wirth ROGS?? 
Please let me know.
