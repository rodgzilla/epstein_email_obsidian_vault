Jeffrey, 
photos of unmasked B727,. Paint shop indicated we can use Vinyl for your "E" Logo and "Flag" as oppose of painting, this 
would enable easy removal if plane sells in the future. Trump and other airlines uses Vinyl for logos,. 
can you sketch the style of "E" for the tail, and I'll request rendering with slanted Flag for Right side of Vertical Stabilizer,. 
thank you, 
Larry
