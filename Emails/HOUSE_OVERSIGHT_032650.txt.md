Reminder: Jojo and Merwin both requested off Nov. 25 and 26 to be with family in town and celebrate 
Brianna's 16th Birthday. We will need to bring Marilyn to NY to help prepare for your arrival. We should 
have Sonam and Leo to help as well. Shall we get a flight for Marilyn early Sat. Nov. 25th morning?
