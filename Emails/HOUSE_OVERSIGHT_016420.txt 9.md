RE: Motion to Unseal Epstein Appeal Briefs
[EXTERNAL]
Jack, after consideration of your request for the unsealing of the appellate briefs with redactions of certain identities, we
take no position on behalf of Mr Epstein. I appreciate your courtesy in providing me with more time to respond given
the holidays. Let me know if this email suffices. Thanks, Marty
