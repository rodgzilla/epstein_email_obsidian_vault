Jeffrey, 
Need your advice. 
My finance minister is telling me that he has an anonymous funds manager who is willing to deposit 4 billion 
dollars in Maldives and that they are willing to lend a percentage of that in exchange for government 
promissory notes. The 4 billion would be deposited in the Central Bank. But they want us to set up a special 
purpose vehicle, a construction company fully owned by the government to receive the loan. Such a company 
can only be set up under a presidential decree. 
I am also told that the funds manager would be charging Maldives upfront a certain percentage of the amount 
lent. 
I don't feel I have enough information on this. I don't know who is this funds manager. They always want the 
finance minister to meet them in Bangkok or some place outside. Why would anyone want to deposit such a 
large amount here when we don't have a credit rating and public debt is so high. I feel very uncomfortable about 
this. 
What do you think I should do. I am very uncomfortable. In addition to the finance minister, a leading politician 
and leader of the coalition parliamentary group is behind it. He could be my leading contender for presidency. 
Does this sound all ridiculous to you. I have a strange feeling about this whole thing. 
Best regards 
Waheed
