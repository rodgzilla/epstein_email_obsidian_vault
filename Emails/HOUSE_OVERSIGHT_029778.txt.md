just as we thought------Russian bank Sberbank has quietly taken over his Capital Group's biggest asset, a 
massive housing, shops and offices project called Gorod Stolits, in Moskva-City on Moscow's outskirts. Under 
a $400 million (£270 million) loan agreement, the bank will ensure construction of the complex goes ahead at 
the end of the year as planned by Doronin, who has been likened to Donald Trump.
