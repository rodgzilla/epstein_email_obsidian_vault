Dear [[Joi]], 
Hello, [[I]]'m writing [[From]] Politico Magazine, where we're working on a special package of stories timed [[To]] Donald Trump's 
inauguration in January, and [[I]] wondered if you would be interested in contributing. 
As he prepares [[To]] take office, our plan is [[To]] publish a handful of out[[-]]of[[-]]the box ideas for President Trump, suggested by 
writers and thinkers [[From]] a variety of fields and ideological positions. Whether the idea has [[To]] do with politics, policy, 
personnel or governing style, we're looking for suggestions that are specific and, above all, surprising; something inventive if 
slightly far[[-]]fetched is better than a pet cause or a well[[-]]trod policy proposal. (This exercise doesn't require that you support or 
even agree with Trump, but it does require a willingness [[To]] engage.) 
Do you have an idea along these lines that you wish the new president would consider, whether something in economics or 
otherwise? If so, [[I]]'d love [[To]] hear, and we can discuss next steps [[From]] there. Ultimately, we're aiming [[To]] publish a handful of 
short pieces (about 800 words each) as a package of proposals. 
Many thanks, and please let me know if you have questions.
