You might recall that we "met" by email and on the phone a couple of years ago, originally through our mutual friend

I have a question for you. I am preparing a lawsuit against the Broward County Sheriff's Department. I am looking for 
a good and trustworthy private investigator there who will not undercut me with the Sheriff's department because of 
ties there, etc. I have a couple of candidates; but someone recently referred me to one in Davie, FL who this person 
said would fit the bill. 
When I went on the guy's website, however, I see that one of the things he apparently holds out as a highlight (it is on 
his "press" page) is a series of stories about your case. I assume the guy was an investigator for the other side in the 
civil case - the group that set you up. 
His name is Mike Fisten and his company is Blueline Investigations. If he is someone who you encountered and he 
was a bad guy or out to get you, I would not want to use him. Even though we don't really know each other, I very 
much liked you when we spoke and I would not want to give business to someone who had gone after you and you 
think is a bad guy. If on the other hand, he was a decent guy just doing his job, perhaps it would be ok. I can't tell 
enough about it from his website.

Any thoughts on the guy? 
Meanwhile, I hope all is going well for you now and I wish you a happy and healthy new year.
