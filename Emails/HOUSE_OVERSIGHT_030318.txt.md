[[Darren]] [[Indyke]] ]; 
Seems very good. Is there reason or opportunity here [[To]] evoke JE's Clinton connection? He had been publicly 
connected [[To]] the former President and became a proxy for the considerable anger at high levels of the Federal 
government that still surrounded Clinton. Likewise now, one reason [[To]] revive the story is that it is a way [[To]] tar a 
Trump administration official, who, in the normal course of his duties, happened [[To]] deal with the case.
