I appreciate the opportunity to respond to your email. While I am running the risk that you will report my comments, if you do, either out 
of context, or incompletely, I am responding with an effort to be complete. It is hard to know how to respond to a list of false and/or 
distorted allegations, along with misleading statements on your part. I treat people I interact with with respect, and I work hard to 
support and mentor students, colleagues, and members of the general public. I do not sexually harass people. If the purpose of your 
reporting is to somehow argue that Universities and other institutions are lax in dealing with well known individuals like myself, then in 
fact the situation is quite the opposite. My high public profile opens me up to more scrutiny at these institutions, not less, and it also 
opens me up to a host of outside complaints and allegations that other faculty do not receive, each of which the University has to 
respond to. The fact that I have remained a professor in all Universities with which I have been associated, in good standing, and also 
an officer or an invited speaker at organizations like CFI, which have strict harassment policies, is a confirmation of the fact that they 
trust my behavior. I was asked to be an honorary director of CFI, and invited to their last 3 meetings to speak, specifically because, as 
they have written me after the fact, the attendees universally appreciated my talks, my courtesy, and graciousness in spending time 
with the attendees. If the purpose of your report is to impugn my integrity or suggest I have a history of harassment, that too is 
false. As noted in one of your 'miscellaneous facts', as a scientist I try and remain skeptical, and rely on empirical evidence, rather than 
allegations and innuendo. I also try and judge the facts in context. The fact that Universities and other organizations employ me or 
have me on their boards, or invite me to meetings is because they value my contributions and my actions. 
The items you list are false or distorted. Item 1 refers falsely and inaccurately to a consensual encounter in my hotel room in 2006 
where we mutually decided, in a polite discussion in fact, that taking it any further would not be appropriate, and there were respectful 
and platonic encounters afterwards. There is nothing to comment on in item 3, which involves an anonymous 3rd party claim because I 
know nothing about it, there are no details provided, and it clearly was not taken seriously enough to result in any university 
action. Item 4 is confusing. Are you saying that because I decided I didn't want to go out to a bar with a group of attendees that I was 
harassing them? The second part did not happen. Re incident 5: The 'female companion' in this case is my wife, who can attest to the 
fact that the claim is false, which is what I wrote at the time in response to the blog in question, causing it to be taken down. 
It is worth responding to Item 2 and 6 in more detail, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021408 
Re item 2: the student in question was interested in science communication, and on dozens of occasions came to me or wrote to me 
with questions. When she asked about advice for after graduation I DID tell her she was different than the other students in her 
year. The rest of them were interested in going on to graduate school, but she was interested in science communication so I told her 
that she might want to take a different path. Since she was the only woman in her year, as I recall, I did ask her on one of these 
occasions if that made it difficult for her in any way. I asked, because as a faculty member I was interested in knowing what we could 
do, if necessary to encourage more women to go into physics, and also because as someone she had asked for career advice from I 
wanted to know if that made a difference to her. Re asking her for dinner.. I have gone back over emails from that period. I have 
numerous requests from her asking me to go for coffee to talk, which I usually had to turn down because I was busy, and on several 
occasions sh specifically asked me to have coffee with her off campus to talk, and I politely declined. I did let her accompany me off 
campus one time to watch me do a BBC interview because she specifically requested it. I did and do have coffee and meals with 
students on campus, and I see nothing wrong with this. I try to treat even students as respected colleagues if possible. I was shocked 
when I later learned of the complaint she was apparently asked to lodge to the University, not least because there was no inappropriate 
interaction and also because, well after the dates you listed on which she was apparently offended, she continued to email me with 
joking questions or comments. Also, at a later AAAS conference, again in 2008, for which she had asked, and for which I had written 
her a letter of recommendation to attend, my wife and I gave her a lift in our taxi well out out of our way in order to drop her off at her 
hotel, and I note in an email response to her email about the conference, agin in 2008, I expressed that I would pass her regards along 
to my wife and vice versa. When the University later informed me of the complaint I was shocked and concerned. When I spoke to 
the human resources person, including relating my concerns and providing the emails in question, I was told that no formal complaint 
of sexual harassment was deemed at that time to be called for, and that the young woman in question had agreed to that. By that time 
I learned of the complaint I had already announced my intentions to leave Case to accept an offer at ASU—a very difficult decision for 
me because of my long-standing attachment to the University, and the excellent relations I had with my colleagues there, both among 
the faculty and among the administration. Because I was already in Arizona at the time I was asked not to have any further interaction 
with the student I agreed to that request, both to respect her sensitivities and also because it was basically moot because I was not on 
campus. I was also told that because it was being handled informally, that (a) it should remain confidential, which I, at least abided by, 
and (b) if no further complaints were lodged in that case, that the University would remove the complaint from my record after 5 years, 
which makes me surprised that someone violated that written agreement with you. 
Re item 6: You report on ASU's response to item #6 , without including the fact that the University specifically stated there were never 
any allegations of sexual misconduct or harassment by me at the University, and morever the outside complaints were in fact related 
specifically to your item #6. Further you neglect to mention that this complaint was by an anonymous third party, not the individual who 
was allegedly harassed, who never lodged a complaint, and that no specific evidence was provided of the alleged transgression. I was 
surprised and dismayed that both ASU and ANU launched investigations on the basis of this but was told by both Universities that 
because of my high profile even such unsubstantiated third party complaints at private events unrelated to the University would be 
investigated. The complaint was investigated throughly by both ASU and ANU and both came to the conclusion that it was not credible 
and no university policies had been violated. . In addition ANU's investigation, which took a full month found significant inconsistencies 
in the allegation, suggesting distortion and fabrication, I will quote from the ANU report. The initial complaint, which in fact resulted in a 
temporary suspension of my position at ANU, until it was dismissed, outlined the claim you made in the words you quoted in your note 
to me, but it also stated 
"It is the University's understanding that a complaint was lodged directly to the conference organisers at the time of the incident." 
After the month-long investigation, during which I was told I was not to interact with anyone on campus (again moot because I was a 
hemisphere removed) the final report absolved me of any wrongdoing, and indicated information inconsistent with the original claim and 
apparent later claims as follows in the report, from which I quote: 
"The allegations were made by an observer to the incident. 
- The complaint did not identify, nor disclose the identity of the conference attendee who was allegedly touched in 
an unwelcome manner. 
- The conference attendee who took the selfie' photo did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference organisers 
at the time of the incident (November 2016). 
- The conference attendee who witnessed the incident, did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference organisers 
at the time of the incident (November 2016). 
The photo submitted as part of the complaint does not provide evidence of any physical contact. 
- The complainant alleged that a photo exists, showing your hand on the breast of the conference attendee who took 
the selfie' photo. This photo was not made available to the Australian National University, although it was requested 
in the course of the investigation." 
(And for the record I often put my hand up in front of a camera if there is a flash, as I specifically request selfies not to include flashes, 
so that I don't end up with a series bright spots in front of my eyes for the next half hour) 
What makes this particular type of allegation so repugnant is that I get asked for literally thousands of selfies, and when people come 
up to me they are vulnerable, often shaking, and sometimes overly aggressive. I am particularly proud of the way I attempt to make all 
people feel at ease, and respected, rather than humiliated. Thus, this false claim strikes at the heart of what I am about, which is to 
acknowledge fans in a way that makes them feel appreciated. As I understand you had a reporter watching me sign books and take 
selfies at the CFI conference in Las Vegas this year, that behavior is what they will have witnessed. Moreover, I am proud of the 
interactions I have had at both Case and ASU, with students, colleagues and staff of all genders and ethnicities. I have worked hard to 
support them, mentor them, and treat them with respect. I treat others as responsible adults, and I expect to be treated equally.
