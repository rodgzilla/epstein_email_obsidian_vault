As [[I]] retire for the night, [[I]]'m reminded of a poem my father was awfully fond of. It seems 
very apt. 
Good night, Jes. 
Worry not of tomorrow's end 
Hurry not towards falling trees 
Ignore at once, the jesters dance 
Sigh, oh sigh, at the folly foiled 
Take down the mighty route of ills 
Lest not make a scratch in time 
Evenhanded wins fair stance. 
Broken wooden spoons we take 
Left, oh left, in such a state 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030355 
Over crests and furrowed field 
Wirey talons arching back 
Empty roosts the plagued aspise 
Revel in their bloodied eyes 
We fight on.
