WASHINGTON (AP) — The Associated Press has learned that investigators working with special counsel Robert Mueller 
have interviewed Tom Barrack, a close friend and confidant of President Donald Trump. 
Three people familiar with the probe tell the AP that Barrack met with federal investigators working on the Russia inquiry. 
The people spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations. 
Barrack's spokeswoman, Lisa Baker, declined to comment. 
Barrack has known Trump for decades. He's been one of Trump's closest advisers through the 2016 campaign and into the 
administration. Barrack also is a leading fundraiser for the president and oversaw the fundraising for the inauguration. 
Barrack has a longstanding relationship with Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and Manafort's onetime 
deputy, Rick Gates. 
Gates agreed to begin cooperating with Mueller's investigators in February.
