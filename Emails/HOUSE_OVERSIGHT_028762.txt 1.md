call me now 
On Mon, May 7, 2012 at 7:21 PM, [[Boris Nikolic]] [[Wrote]]: 
It was not easy as people [[From]] LifeBall are very difficult. But [[I]] go it (they even now approved you - they 
needed [[To]] do a background check believe it or not! — as on that dinner will be president of Austria, Clinton etc) 
for two tickets — for you and your guest for a price that you do not need [[To]] buy a table (as they do not sell 
individual seats). 
Guy below is a good friend and he is a CEO of amFAR (amFAR has a joined dinner) — so he helped. 
The nice thing about these tickets is that they are the most VIP. It includes reception, dinner, gala and after all 
party access. 
[[I]] have the same ones (through Bill). 
[[I]] also got two additional for you but it turns out that they are not the same level so [[I]] reached [[To]] Kevin for help. 
The price is 2,500Euro per ticket (this is very reduced price as [[I]] think the regular one for this is 15K and it is 
hard [[To]] get it). They will need an email [[From]] someone [[From]] your office and name a your guest asap. 
The plan for for Vienna [[I]] am sending you with my next email! 
Boris
