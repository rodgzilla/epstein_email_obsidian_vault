Hi [[Jeffrey]], 
[[I]] saw [[Tom]] McMillen last night and he asked about you - said he lost touch. He's tight with the Obama's and is going [[To]] be 
an Ambassador - apparently any country he wants. So great! [[I]]'d LOVE [[To]] be an Ambassador and am going attempt [[To]] 
raise enough money on the next election cycle. 
His info is: 
and [[I]] hesitate [[To]] give him your info [[W]]/out ur permission... 
Am doing Aspen Institute Socrates Society program over President's weekend if you're in Aspen! Miss you! 
Love and Happiness, Gwendolyn 
PS. Have a conference call with Jessica Joffe tomorrow.
