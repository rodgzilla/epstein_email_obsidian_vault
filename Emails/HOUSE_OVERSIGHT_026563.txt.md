is my friend there who will host us. She is very close friend with as well. 
and I are still trying to get to join at the last moment. 
She and her family own 80% or so of Austrian media (Heute etc). She is describing program below. 
The plan would be that we arrive to Vienna on Thursday 17th mid day. 
On Thursday there is a big Premiere of Mozart La Clemenza de Tito and we go to that. 
ON Friday •is organizing a dinner/reception with her friends. We can schedule some other 
meetings/visits during day. 
On Saturday the night starts at 5pm and goes through early next morning. 
I leave first flight Sunday morning for San Francisco to meet Bill. 
If you are staying in Vienna and have time (and like you should go to her brunch. 
How this seems to you???
