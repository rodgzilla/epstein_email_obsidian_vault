[[I]] am writing in an attempt [[To]] make contact with [[Jeffrey]] [[Epstein]] and wondered if you would, as his attorney, forward this message on 
[[To]] him? 
We are keen [[To]] explore the possibility of conducting an interview with Mr [[Epstein]], on the [[Subject]] of the stories which are circulating, 
however inaccurately, about both him and Prince Andrew, [[The Duke]] of York; we'd be keen [[To]] hear [[From]] Mr [[Epstein]] first hand so that 
the various and at times, speculative reporting which is at large in the UK press can be better scrutinised? 
Let me tell you a bit about the Today programme. 
Today is the BBC's main morning news show; we have been part of the BBC for over 50 years and are generally considered one of the 
most important news broadcast outlets - either on radio or TV - here in the UK. We set the news agenda for the BBC and in many 
respects we set the daily news agenda for the country. Our interviews are regularly re broadcast across the BBC's national and 
international news network including - BBC World, BBC World Service and BBC Online. The combination of these outlets means 
the global 'reach of a BBC Today programme interview is second [[To]] none. 
Programme guests have included a selection of some of the biggest names in politics, business, international relations and the arts 
including US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, President [[Nicholas]] Sarkozy, President Hamid Karzai, HRH the Prince of Wales, 
former President Musharraf, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, former President Bill Clinton, Senator George Mitchell, Al 
Gore, Kofi Annan, former Prime Minister Tony Blair, the Dalai Lama, [[Bill Gates]], George Soros, Stephen Hawking, Sir Paul 
McCartney, Mick Jaggar and Salman Rushdie. 
We are a programme that carries considerable weight and influence and which prides itself in being a first port of call for many of the 
most important and influential figures on the international stage. 
[[I]] can best be reached [[Via]] my cell phone - 
My very best wishes and my thanks!
