[[I]] thought you might find this amusing. "But more often then not, the team of economic advisers was 
operating [[From]] different playbooks, with [[Summers]] calling his plays the loudest. Take, for instance, the debate 
that surrounded the Volcker rule -- the regulatory reform component that curtailed proprietary trading at U.S. 
banks and limited their investments in private equity firms and hedge funds. As Wolffe reports: 
[[[Summers]]'] doubts sat there in the West Wing, blocking the Volcker rule for months. Obama had 
signaled that he wanted the rule [[To]] move forward back in October. The banks were on safe ground again, 
but could still benefit [[From]] subsidized lending by the federal government. That seemed wrong when they 
could use the money [[To]] trade for themselves rather than lend it [[To]] customers in the real economy... Biden 
was an old friend of Volcker 's and started [[To]] press for the rule [[To]] take force. But as the weeks dragged on, 
[[Summers]] rehashed his same old questions and concerns. At one fall meeting with his economics team in 
the Oval Office, Obama wanted [[To]] know why nothing had moved yet. [[Summers]] dug in once again, while 
Geithner - whose media coverage cast him as a supposed ally of Wall Street - wanted [[To]] push ahead.
