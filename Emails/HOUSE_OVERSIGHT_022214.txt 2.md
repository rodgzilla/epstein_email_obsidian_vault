Yes, one of the most complex negotiations they re very strange. Someone buys fighters but with 
the fighter money, some must be used for specific third party items. I will buy your pussy for 10k, 
but with 2 of the 10 you have to buy me food. And to make matter worse I need to borrow thev10 
from you.

Do you understand offset agreements? I got asked to be involved in negotiating some of the deals between Brazil and 
other countries in regards to the purchase of new fighter jets.. 
What is an offset service provider?
