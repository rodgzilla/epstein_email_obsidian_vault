Now everyone coming [[To]] me thinking [[I]] have juicy info on you and Trump. 
Because of this. 
"[[I]]'ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy," Trump booms [[From]] a speakerphone. "He's a lot of fun [[To]] be with. It is even 
said that he likes beautiful women as much as [[I]] do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- [[Jeffrey]] 
enjoys his social life." 
That story will never die.
