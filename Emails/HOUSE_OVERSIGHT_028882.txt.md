Dear [[Jeffrey]], 
[[Larry]] has told me that you and a friend would like [[To]] contribute [[To]] my project (hallelujah and thank you a 
million times, [[Jeffrey]]) and that [[I]] ought [[To]] write up a proposal asking for 500,000. This is wonderful. If this 
comes [[To]] pass, the best way for that money [[To]] come, [[I]] think, is as a gift [[To]] Poetry in America, an initiative at 
EdLabs at Harvard University. This will give me discretion over its disbursement [[To]] HarvardX and WGBH, but 
this will be absolutely be a Harvard gift that will count as Campaign success and [[From]] which Harvard will take 
some (but not as much)overhead. . So far the best finance people [[I]]'ve met are at EdLabs and they are happy [[To]] 
manage these funds for me. There are other ways [[To]] give me this money that leave Harvard out, but my 
understanding is that your friend would like this [[To]] be a Harvard gift. 
Here's a draft of what [[I]]'d like [[To]] do with that money. 
[[I]]'d like 500,000 [[To]] do post[[-]]production and distribution of a whole historical period of American poetry (1914-
1945 is what [[I]]'m thinking—Modernism) and including three episodes of tv. 
The raw materials for that period include interviews with Bill Clinton (including footage not yet used by 
WGBH), Peter Gallison, Walter Isaacson, Lena Dunham, Woody Allen (whose lawyers didn't like our release a 
while ago, but we're hoping will soften over time), Harrison Ford (still a maybe), [[Robert]] Polito, Sarah Kay, Al 
Filreis, Rafael Campo, Susan Howe, kids [[From]] Nantucket High School, kids [[From]] Brookline High 
School, Alfre Woodard, Jane Pickering, Jay Parini, Ray Dalio, Leon Wieseltier, Richard Dawkins and others; 
and footage shot in Harlem, Greenwich Village, midtown, Chicago, London (if [[I]] have the money [[To]] hire a crew 
there; don't now ), at museums including the Fogg, Harvard Museum of Natural History, [[Frost]]'s house in Ripton 
Vermont and more. 
This allows the donor [[To]] give [[To]] a big Harvard Campaign priority, Teaching and Learning , by supporting Poetry 
in America, allowing me [[To]] produce the crucial segment of the online course with the highest (TV quality) 
production values and so also supplying higher quality video [[To]] WGBH as a way also [[To]] cut their costs. 
Currently, HarvardX skimps (on lighting, for instance--see the Bill Clinton interview) and while WGBH ladles 
money raised by others into everything. [[I]] have been pounding away at my friends at WGBH and [[I]] know that 
WGBH producer will work with HarvardX if they can give him footage of the right quality. . That is, we'll use 
HarvardX as the backlot for WGBH so as [[To]] squeeze three episodes out for 250. 
This proposal does not include experiments in schools or the curricular development into courses for teachers 
that you've seen in other (million dollar ) proposals. But the courses for teachers can't happen before the 
footage is developed, and these courses will have as their centerpiece the WGBH episodes, and so this funding 
will make all the rest possible. 
[[I]] can polish this narrative and or edit it, if there are things you think [[I]] have wrong. 
And [[I]] can attach a draft budget based on real Harvard numbers (what my Harvard video editor, producer, media 
manager cost) as well as a draft WGBH budget [[I]]'ll now go an negotiate with them. Or we can do that at a 
second stage. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028882 
Let me know what you think? And when are we reading Whitman together. Why don't we set a [[Date]] for Feb 
when Poetry in America 3: Whitman is running online and we could screen a little video and then have a 
discussion around your table with you and some friends?
