They try [[To]] keep this story going [[From]] every angle. Now dershowitz isn't involved; rather he is a high powered 
lawyer. [[I]] didn't know you also had lefkowitz. [[I]] met the guy once when a prospective client asked me [[To]] try a 
case with him. One meeting was enough for me [[To]] see clearly that that would not have worked out well; but he 
apparemtly is a successful lawyer. 
One thing for sure the article gets wrong - that the "victims" were silenced. 
Hope you are doing well.
