My initial estimate, given to me by Pablos, was 25, and that was based solely on his quick look at the situation, and 
not knowing what was really out there. In fact, as I have repeated many times, the job was far far worse that 
originally expected, you have a dedicated group of people trying to undo and damage you, including now, they have 
started up in the last week full force again, as it is obvious that they can't fux with your wild page any more as we 
blocked that.. The woman from the Daily Beast. We have programs that track this stuff, and so, for the past few 
days, Mike has been having a cyber war with her minions, who are actively trying to undo what we are doing, as she 
is trying to push her Daily beast and other articles back up. So, we have to go back and push them back down. 
Then, there was the issue of trying to create additionally on you a positive web presence, with the science and org 
sites. 
I spend literally four months of non-stop work, creativity, and my own political capital to getyou this so far, which 
saved you not only time, but countless dollars, and isn't something that can be readily bought. I had people working 
also for free. I gained access to information that standard seo companies don't have. In addition, I wasted a lot of 
time talking to people who promise to help, but end up providing nothing, and so, I end up having to do it myself. 
What do I get in return, constant back slapping to my head... 
We were trying to fix up your mess. I didn't create it. Just thought it would be something to help. This was 
NEVER about trying to pull money out of you, and fact, we have don't everything possible to keep the costs down 
considerably. 
I must talk to you about the island thing asap. When can we do that?
