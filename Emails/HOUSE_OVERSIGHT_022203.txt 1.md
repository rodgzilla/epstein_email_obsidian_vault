the google page is not good.. after sept when you told me you thought it would take approx twenty thousand to 
clean up. and hopefully in time for nov 1. then another ten thsousand, and another ten thousand. and your 
emails about how you are all about results „ then an emergency 2500 dollars to keep servers active , then you 
told me micahel didn't want to give his bank details.. your quote was he'd explode, that was after he was sent 
forty thousand dollars directly to his bank.. I have yet to have a complete breakdown of payments. and the 
results , are what they are,.
