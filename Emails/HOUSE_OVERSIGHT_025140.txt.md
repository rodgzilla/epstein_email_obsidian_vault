perhaps i misunderstood "let's concentrate on you" 
Jamaica is bad enough but i have mastered that—at least the danger-4th highest murder rate in the world 
as for the us i have alienated large stretches of it—i will spare you the details 
i was amused that you are now friends with JD Watson 
he single-handedly prevented me from getting a Junior Fellowship at Harvard 
In 1972 I got my PhD in Biology and it was conventional to nominate the very best post-docs for a Junior 
Fellowship, Harvard's most prestigious award—it provided three years of research support without any duties. I 
was the best student out of Evolutionary and Organismic Biology in more than 20 years. The entire department 
was behind me. 
but Watson was on the 3-man committee, in charge of all the science candidates and he deemed my two papers, 
reciprocal altruism and parental investment and sexual selection as "not being science" and dismissed me in one 
sentence. Well bless his soul, he now does not even understand his own subject—yes, i speak of genetics—
because having remained resolutely ignorant of evolutionary logic and biology he can neither understand the 
shape and form of the genotype nor how it differs systematically within life 
i have been preparing something for you for a long time on human intelligence, Africa, parasites etc because i 
prefer to get things right but i am ready to send you what i have 
main focus is—Africans stupid or smart?
