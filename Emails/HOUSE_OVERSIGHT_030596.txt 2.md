Swiss Accounts Survey 
Dear Mr [[Epstein]], 
We are writing because a US media organisation, in concert with ourselves at the Guardian newspaper in 
London, is currently conducting a detailed survey of Swiss bank accounts, past and present. 
It is not illegal [[To]] have Swiss accounts. But as you may know, it is a topic of considerable public debate, and 
several governments have been investigating the owners of such accounts. 
There are a number of ways such accounts and also offshore trusts have been used [[To]] avoid inheritance tax, UK 
domestic tax, or tax imposed by other countries. Such accounts have also been used [[To]] launder money. 
We have seen records held in the US identifying you among those who have held accounts. These accounts 
contained assets of up [[To]] USD 3.5m, and include: 
[[1]]) You may therefore have been a person evading or avoiding tax, or laundering money. 
We will be particularly concerned with these questions: 
2) Why you had Swiss accounts. 
3) How much back tax you have settled with the tax authorities following their investigation of your affairs. 
Additionally, [[From]] public records and [[From]] material we have seen we note that: 
4) In 2008 you pleaded guilty [[To]] solicitation of prostitution and procuring minors for prostitution. You were 
sentenced [[To]] 18 months in prison.

5) Your above accounts were also linked with Mr Leslie Wexner. 
6) You are known [[To]] be or have previously been closely associated with Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew and 
Kevin Spacey. 
7) You have made substantial contributions [[To]] the Clintons' philanthropic causes. Tax reform campaigners 
have previously been critical of those who engage in public life or the political process while avoiding or 
evading tax. Hilary Clinton herself, speaking in 2012, noted the importance of elites paying a substantial share 
of tax: "One of the issues that [[I]] have been preaching about around the world is collecting taxes in an equitable 
manner — especially [[From]] the elites in every country." 
It is intended shortly [[To]] publish the results of our survey in both the US and the UK. 
As responsible journalists acting in the public interest, we would first like [[To]] give you the opportunity [[To]] 
comment. 
If we do not hear [[From]] you by 18:00 on Monday 12th January 2015 (preferably by email [[To]]
