[[Michael]], 
Thanks for your time on Friday, it was great [[To]] hear more about FIO, we are keen [[To]] hear more. 
In terms of follow up 
- we look forward [[To]] receiving the White Paper that you mentioned. 
- we will consider opportunities in Russia, principally [[Via]] Rusnano, who we are in discussions 
with http://www.rusnano.com/Home.aspx?dummy=634236281106041875  
- you asked about Onexim, this is the principal investment vehicle for Prokhorov (think New Jersey 
Nets). He's reckoned [[To]] be the wealthiest man in Russia post[[-]]crisis. He is investing more in nanotech and 
green energy projects. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029915 
- London meeting - please let us know dates when you might be coming through Europe. 
- NY meeting - we will update when we know more about plans [[To]] come [[To]] New York as we could also aim 
[[To]] meet there. 
Let's keep in touch and see where we get. 
Best 
Ben
