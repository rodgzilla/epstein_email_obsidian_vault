Well i should have figured it was only a matter of time before some other brilliant lawyer tried to find a way to 
tie you to Trump and see if he could money off it and now i just read exactly that with this guy cheney 
mason. Unbelievable. These guys just love the publicity - clinton, dershowitz, now Trump. First these 
"friends" act like anything but your friend once they get sued; then the next joker of a lawyer decides to join this 
cottage industry of suing you and hoping either you settle or the "friend" settles. 
Sorry to see this. Good luck.

Just read the Fox News piece today rehashing old stories. The media just cannot let go and loves to think of 
new angles to get you in headlines. Sorry to see it; but i am sure by now you can deal with it for what it is. 
I appreciate the call from Darren a few weeks ago and would have loved to have a fought a battle for the fellow 
at issue. But once he let me know the guy had been served and it was just a matter if defending a deposition, i 
suggested that it might be a waste of money to have me handle that. I hope it worked out. I am more than 
happy to get involved any time in any way i can help - and i would like to think i could help with what i bring 
to the table. I just did not feel in that circumstance that you did not need me adding to the milking of resources 
that i am sure has been going on with lawyers for years. 
I would have felt differently if it were a matter if taking depositions or actually litigating a case. I would like 
to think that in that circumstance i could add value. If we ever meet, i will tell you a bit about depositions i 
took not long ago of the leaders of the PFLP terrorist organization. That was my kind of setting. 
Please know that i am here to help in any way i can with any case or just for advice if you think my help would 
be meaningful. Your situation seems to me to raise the combination of friends you have been very good to 
using all you gave them and then ditching you and sharks swarming when they smell blood and i don't like to 
see either. 
I "met" you originally through a friend i like very much. I wish it had been earlier in time; but looking to the 
present and future, you just let me know if you need me. 
Take care.

Sorry to see they are still dragging your name through the press. I hope some of the legal matters have been resolved 
since last we spoke. I would have liked to have helped. I am sure you have the lawyers you feel are the best for you 
and I hope that is the case and all works out well as soon as possible.
