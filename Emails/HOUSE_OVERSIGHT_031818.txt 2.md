[[I]] [[Subject]]: RE:

[[I]] understand your frustrations and appreciate your willingness [[To]] figure out a solution. [[I]] have some ideas which [[I]] will 
send you over the weekend if that is OK. 
Re Broadcom: the stock is up $[[1]].20 at $211.50. After the initial shock reaction of yesterday, there has been a lot of 
focus on the cost synergies etc. but very little conviction in revenue opportunities. However until we hear [[From]] 
management as [[To]] the overall intentions of the deal, uncertainty will linger.

This morning the pricing is as follows: 
Aug 200 Puts cost $4.10 
Sept 200 Puts cost $7.90 
Earning are on 08/30. So worst case is the uncertainty lingers until then which would argue [[To]] buy the Sept puts. 
However [[I]] still prefer buying the Aug puts as [[I]] would fully expect more clarity [[From]] management before August expiry.
