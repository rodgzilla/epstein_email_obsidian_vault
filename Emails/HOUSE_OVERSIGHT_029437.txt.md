attached a message [[I]] just [[Sent]] [[To]] President Struppa of Chapman—[[I]] am certain that your gift will do the trick—
and that the West Coast is indeed more convivial and supportive than the East 
[[I]] hope [[I]] did not f... up your contact with Finkelstein 
Carlos told me of the devastation [[To]] your island—pretty much as [[I]] feared 
am amused (at a safe distance) as Bannon takes on Trump—he responds as he always does, threatening a suit he 
will not in fact file 
no internet in my home or nearby in the great, retarded country of Jamaica so [[I]] am now at a restaurant some 35 
minutes away and only go on[[-]]line twice a day—hoping that [[I]] will work instead 
all best
