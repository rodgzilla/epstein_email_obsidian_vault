Boris: 
Here is the information sheet for [[Jeffrey]] [[To]] buy tickets. Tell him [[To]] use my name and the name of Magdalena 
Schuster on the email below. They've already approved him [[To]] buy tickets [[To]] Lifeball and the Gala dinner 
which happens right before the ball. [[I]] hope you guys are all planning [[To]] attend the dinner as well. You can tell 
your friend [[Jeffrey]] that he should buy the Mini car for me as a thank you. =) 
[[I]]'m getting in [[To]] Vienna on Friday afternoon. Let's get together on Friday night. 
See you soon, 
Kevin
