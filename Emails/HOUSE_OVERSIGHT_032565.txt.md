What nice coverage in the Huffington Post. 
Living in Europe, [[I]] was not aware that Trump's proposed cuts will be so devastating [[To]] the scientific 
community. 
You asked me if [[I]] would be in New York September 18. Did you have something in mind? 
[[I]] am 77 and do not travel so well. [[I]] have cut back on my plans [[To]] travel. [[I]] can consider coming [[To]] New York, 
September has anything [[To]] do specifically with the vagus nerve - and if it cannot be done with a conference 
call on Skype. 
[[I]] will be able [[To]] stop in NYC on a future trip. 
[[Linda Stone]] was the person who [[I]] met with years ago. It was Linda who suggested that [[I]] contact you. 
best wishes, 
Stanley
