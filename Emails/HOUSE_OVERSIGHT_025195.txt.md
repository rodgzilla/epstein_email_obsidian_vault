representing POTUS and know what to do when potus lies to u. 
My world thinks poorly of Gorelick for representing Jared. 
How guilty is Donald? 
Of crudity surely 
Of gross ignorance surely 
Of being utterly without the intellect temperament for job surely 
Of being over line on family profiting very likely 
Of gross disregard for appearances almost surely. 
Of Russians having financial leverage. Less clear 
Of Russians helping in. Election w complicity of his campaign plausible but not certain 
Strikes me if u work for Donald u don't free lance so he is guilty of whatever his campaign did. 
Do u agree w foregoing?
