The obituary of unique comedian Irwin Corey stated, "Over a career that spanned more than 70 years, Corey 
performed in vaudeville, radio, television, films, Broadway, nightclubs and Las Vegas showrooms." 
In 1983, [[I]] was fortunate [[To]] be booked as the opening act for Corey in a four[[-]]day run at the Julia 
Morgan Theater in Berkeley. He revealed his dark side in a room backstage, where we smoked 
a joint, and he told me how he used [[To]] read Nazi hate literature [[To]] get him in the mood [[To]] 
perform. And there was a certain sense of continuity on his deathbed. The night before he died, he said [[To]] a 
close friend, James Drougas, "Trump will be assassinated soon." 
"Professor" Corey also had a humanitarian streak. In 1996, in my magazine, The Realist, [[I]] published a photo of 
him, [[From]] a video by his son Richard, presenting Fidel Castro a bag of California[[-]]grown pistachio nuts (Castro 
said, "California, hmmmm, good climate there for nuts"), a book on the Rosenberg controversy, and a credit-
card[[-]]size calculator (Castro said, "[[I]]'ll have [[To]] use my little pinky [[To]] push the buttons"). Dave Channon reported 
thatCorey was on a diplomatic mission [[To]] lift the embargo on health supplies [[To]] Cuba, and he visited a hospital 
that was providing sophisticated treatment for the survivors of Chernobyl. Cuban health care provided for more 
radiation victims than than did the U. .5."
