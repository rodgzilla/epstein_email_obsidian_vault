REMEMBERING CAVALIER MAGAZINE 
; Mrisman02 
LAUNCHING A MAGAZINE 
My friend [[Michael]] Simmons, who has been the editor of National Lampoon and High 
Times, observes that cavalier hired fine scribes. A few examples: Thomas Pynchon, Philip Roth, 
William Saroyman, Isaac Asimov, Theodore Sturgeon. Cavalier was launched by Fawcett 
Publications in 1952. 
Men's magazine Cavalier (motto: "For the American Male") was published the year 
before Playboy [[To]] whom it has often been compared, and back in the day tried [[To]] be seen as 
slightly hipper, more youthful and considered a bit more clever than its big name rival. Almost 
an anti[[-]]establishment Playboy. A slogan stated: "Your dad bought Playboy, you 
bought Cavalier." 
[[I]] BECAME A COLUMNIST 
[[I]] was invited [[To]] write a column, named "The Naked Emperor," for Cavalier, that was beginning 
[[To]] publish underground writers and artists. They paid me $[[1]],000 a month. My first column was a 
report on an auction of two[[-]]inch squares [[From]] the hotel bedsheets slept on by the Beatles during 
their first trip [[To]] America. 
There were 300 screaming young [[Girls]], off on a fetishist's holiday. Obviously, there wouldn't be 
enough items [[To]] go around, but it was announced that the Beatles' unwashed towels and bed 
linens were [[To]] be cut into two[[-]]inch squares and sold for $[[1]] each. The price included a notarized 
statement of authenticity. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031973 
My second column was about Lenny Bruce___titled "Lenny the Lawyer," since he defended 
himself in trials He was arrested for obscene performances only because there were no blasphemy 
laws. [[I]] went [[To]] the bank and deposited my check, withdrawing half of it in cash, a $500 bill. 
Lenny was alone in his hotel room on Christmas Day when [[I]] presented it [[To]] him. And, with a 
large safety pin, Lenny attached the $500 bill [[To]] the outside breast pocket of his denim dungaree 
[[J]] acket. 
AFTER JFK ASSASSINATION 
In another column of mine, "Jack Ruby and His Dirty Little Secret," it began, "Lenny Bruce 
told me how all the night club comics used [[To]] Jack Ruby's "tattoo of a lady's schmutzik (translate: 
pussy) in his armpit." If it wasn't a fact, [[I]] was quite willing [[To]] settle for an apocryphal allusion 
which nevertheless crystallized the entire personality of that alleged murderer who wanted so 
very much [[To]] be liked. 
[[I]] say alleged because upon Ruby's own death. Dallas District Attorney Henry Wade said he 
would dismiss the murder charge against him, a promise which has since been kept, although no 
such posthumous grace was ever officially bestowed on Lee Harvey Oswald. See, they grant you 
retroactive innocence only in the face of innumerable witnesses who were present at the actual 
event through the miracle of inadvertent televised coverage. 
Now Jack Ruby's dirty little secret has been forever sealed away in his armpit by the hymen of 
history. Oh yeah, and at Lenny's funeral, that safety pin was still attached on his jacket. 
JULES SIEGEL 
Two years before Lenny's death, with his permission [[I]] published his obituary in my own 
magazine, The Realist. Before the issue went [[To]] press, he called his mother and a few others [[To]] 
let them know it would only be a hoax. The point was that he couldn't get work and his work was 
his life so he might as well be dead. And if people regretted that they hadn't helped him, well, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031974 
now they could have a second chance because he was still alive. The obituary evoked inquiries 
[[From]] newspapers, wire services, foreign publications, radio and TV. 
"What's the meaning of it?" one editor asked me. "There's a lot of excitement at the city 
desk." 
"That is the meaning of it." 
A few years later, without my permission, Jules Siegel, the editor of a short[[-]]lived 
magazine, Cheetah, published a fake obituary of me. [[I]] thought it was funny. An Associated Press 
reporter called, and [[I]] explained that it was a hoax. 
"Are you sure?" he asked. 
"Of course. [[I]] would tell you if [[I]] was dead." 
Siegel started writing for cavalier. His first assignment was a profile of Sterling Hayden, an actor 
best known in Dr, Stranglove or How [[I]] Learned [[To]] Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb. 
Journalist Adam Ellsworth described Siegel's "Goodbye Surfing, Hello God" with his most 
famous example of rock journalism, but his most revolutionary was his article, "The Big Beat." 
It appeared in the Playboy[[-]]esque Cavalier magazine in 1965 and was one of the earliest writings 
he'd ever seen on the development of rock and roll, [[From]] slaves singing in chains on their way [[To]] 
America [[To]] Bob Dylan "going electric" at the Newport Folk Festival. 
Then Jules' friend, Arthur Kretchmer, became Cavalier's managing editor. "When the editorial 
director later resigned," Kretchmer said, "there was a 24[[-]]hour hiatus before the new editor 
arrived." Siegel and Kretchmer had been discussing the possibility of publishing an issue on rock 
and roll, so [[To]] make it happen, Kretchmer went into the office at night and retyped the magazine's 
schedule [[To]] include their ideas. 
When the new editorial started, Kretchmer handed him the schedules and said, "Here's what 
we're working on." The new editorial director suspected nothing and the rock and roll issue went 
ahead. Once the laughter died down, Jules talked for a good 25 minutes about 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031975 
some of the ups and downs of his writing career and how hard it is [[To]] make a 
living as any kind of a writer, let alone a "rock journalist." and the people who 
created it, seriously. 
Now everybody writes about rock and roll that way. Jules was one of the 
people who did it first. "Goodbye Surfing, Hello God!" is Jules's most famous 
example of rock journalism, but [[I]] think his most revolutionary is his article 
"The Big Beat." It appeared in the Playboy[[-]]esque Cavalier magazine in 1965 
and is one of the earliest writings [[I]]'ve ever seen on the development of rock 
and roll, [[From]] slaves singing in chains on their way [[To]] America [[To]] Bob Dylan 
"going electric" at the Newport Folk Festival. 
Jules Siegel died of a heart attack on November 17, 2012 at the age of 77. 
He was a brilliant author, but neither Rolling Stone nor the New York 
Times honored him with an obituary. Not even a fake one. 
COMIC STRIPS 
Art Spiegelman tells me his work at Cavalier 50 years ago: 
[[I]] was first invited into the mag [[To]] do two full[[-]]color comix pages in 1969 (when being printed in color 
was a Very Big Deal for me as was Getting Paid more than 25 bucks for a drawing), somehow in 
proximity [[To]] a big article on underground comix. It was around the time Vaughn Bode was made a 
regular contributor [[To]] the magazine, They were running some Crumb "Fritz the Cat" pages. All thanx 
[[To]] their hip, laid back and kind editor, [[Alan]] LeMond. 
[[I]] also did some gag cartoons, short strips and occasional illustrations for Cavalier (one especially 
bad drawing for a story by Bruce Jay Friedman, [[I]] recall). My work in 1969, as an apprentice 
underground cartoonist taking too many drugs was really, really awful so [[I]]'m grateful for the editor's 
hip and laid[[-]]back kindness. But, hey, [[I]] was proud [[To]] be in a mag that published pieces by Pynchon, 
Manny Farber and you. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031976 
By the time [[I]]'d gotten incrementally better as a cartoonist in the first half of the 1970s [[I]] was regularly 
doing illustrations for soft[[-]]core fiction stories in Cavalier's low[[-]]rent sister 
mags, Dude, Gent and Nugget (even [[Wrote]] a story or two there and got several of my San Francisco 
comix cronies (Spain Rodriguez, Bill Griffith and Justin Greene) illustration gigs with [[Alan]] for those 
mags as well.

[Note in Wikipedia: Maus is a graphic novel by American cartoonist Art Spiegelman, 
serialized [[From]] 1980 [[To]] 1991. It depicts Spiegelman interviewing his father about his experiences 
as a Polish Jew and Holocaust survivor. The work employs postmodemist techniques and 
represents Jews as mice, Germans as cats, and Poles as pigs. In 1992, Maus won a Pulitzer Prize.] 
COMIING AND GOING 
[[I]] [[Wrote]] some movie reviews for Cavalier. [[I]] recall that Midnight Cowboy was 50 years ago. [[I]] 
always went [[To]] two screenings. The first one [[I]] would go stoned with magic mushrooms. The 
second one [[I]] took notes. However, [[I]] got fired by Cavalier. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031977 
They declined [[To]] publish a particular column--my review of MASH as though it were a Busby 
Berkeley musical called Gook Killers of 1970-- ostensibly on the grounds of bad taste, but [[I]] 
learned that three wholesalers had told the publisher they were pressured by the [[Fbi]] and would 
refuse [[To]] distribute Cavalier if my name appeared in it. 
On top of that, my name was on a list of sixty[[-]]five "radical" campus speakers, released by the 
House Internal Security Committee. The blacklist was published in the New York Times, and 
picked up by newspapers across the country. It might have been a coincidence, but my campus-
speaking engagement[[-]]bookings stopped abruptly. It felt just like a film. 
OH, WELL 
It was over for me, but it had been fun___like the issue with only the one large red headline 
on the Cavalier cover: "BEAT 'EM SENSELESS FIRST"___THE FREE SPEECH 
CONTROVERSY, BY [[Paul Krassner]] . . . "Ironically," [[I]] [[Wrote]], "it is this concept of the 
total education experience on campus which [[I]] believe [[To]] be the basic significance of the much-
misunderstood free[[-]]speech imbroglio at the University of California in Berkeley." 
The sit[[-]]in lasted till 3 a.m. Next day, October [[1]], 1964, ten tables were manned again, and 
a campus policeman approached one of the tables (manned by the Congress of Racial Equality) 
where a dozen persons were seated. One was singled out and placed under arrest. But before you 
could say nonviolent demonstration, the police car was surrounded, its captors reaching as many 
as 3,000 students. During the late evening, bored fraternity men gathered and tossed lighted 
cigarettes and eggs on those sitting in the plaza. The demonstrators responded with silence. 
Next day, 450 police assembled on campus [[To]] remove the cop car and its arrested inhabitant, 
but an agreement [[To]] negotiate was reached and the demonstrators dispersed. One of the folk songs 
[[To]] come out of the Free Speech Movement incidentally, was If [[I]] Negotiate With You, [[To]] the tune 
of the Beatles' If IFell in Love With You. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031978 
Over the next couple of months there was a series of sit[[-]]ins and attempted negotiations, and 
then, on December 2, the infamous Sproul Hall sit[[-]]in. It took twelve hours for 800 students [[To]] be 
arrested by some 600 instructors of a new course called Introductory Police Brutality. These were 
[[From]] the lab notes student took. 
There was a freshman co-[[Ed]] at Berkeley who___long after she had forgotten what some 
professor spouted during an official lecture about Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment___would 
remember, with perhaps a twinge of frightened pride, learning [[From]] a fellow demonstrator that if 
she planned [[To]] go limp when the police arrested her, it would be an act of practical feminine 
foresight [[To]] remove the earrings [[From]] her pierced lobes in advance. 
So, now in 2019, fighting over free speech has been happening heavily at Berkeley campus again. 
Meanwhile, Trump grabbed a pussy on the Statue of Liberty. Cavalier, anyone?
