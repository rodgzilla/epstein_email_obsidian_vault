Hi [[Jeffrey]], 
[[I]] got more votes than Jeb Bush got in Iowa, and [[I]] only had one congressional district, he had four!! It's so funny ([[To]] me — 
totally embarrassing [[To]] him)!!! Still like Trump 0 and might be a delegate [[To]] the republican convention. 
Was in St. Thomas for a couple of days — did call this island, but never heard back. Went scuba diving off St. Jeff and it 
was beautiful. Would be totally funny ([[To]] me at least) if you put a big fake shark or statute under the water where the 
divers go.... 
Love ya, 
INW
