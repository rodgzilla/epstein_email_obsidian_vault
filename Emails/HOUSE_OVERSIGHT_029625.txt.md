[[Jeffrey]] [[Epstein]], Jew Billionaire Pedophile, Child Trafficker Goes Free..WoW! 20 year old Hearsay is enough [[To]] destroy catholic 
priest. What happened here [[To]] the justice system? 
[[Conchita Sarnoff]] 
http://www.thedailyb...hile- goes-free/ 
[[Conchita Sarnoff]] has developed multimedia communication programs for Fortune 500 companies and has produced three current events 
debate television programs, The Americas Forum, [[From]] Beirut [[To]] Kabul, and a segment for The Oppenheimer Report. She is writing a 
book about child trafficking in America. 
Hedge fund mogul and sex offender [[Jeffrey]] [[Epstein]], who went free this week, lived in a depraved world of thrice[[-]]daily massages, 
pornographic artwork, and hush money—that's only now being revealed. [[Conchita Sarnoff]] follows up on her investigation of the legal 
wrangling that saved him [[From]] a long prison term and reports on the sordid details in part two of her exclusive exposé. Also: 
• Palm Beach's police chief objected [[To]] [[Epstein]]'s "special treatment" and gave The Daily Beast an exclusive look at his nine[[-]]hour 
deposition about the investigation. 
• Earlier versions of the U.S attorney's charaes. includina a sealed 53[[-]]naae indictment, could have landed [[Epstein]] in nrison for 20 years. 
• Victims  a lle creel that [[Epstein]] mn1PctPd iindPra tTP trirls [[From]] South America. FurnnP and the former Soviet rPnriblicc includinu three 19- 
year[[-]]old [[Girls]] brought over [[From]] France as a birthday gift. 
• The victims also alleged trips out of state and abroad on [[Epstein]]'s private jets, which would be evidence of sex trafficking—a much 
more serious federal crime than the state charges [[Epstein]] was convicted of. 
• [[Epstein]]'s attorneys investigated members of the Palm Beach Police Department, while others ordered private investigators [[To]] follow and 
intimidate the victims' families; one even posed as a police officer. 
• Then[[-]]Attorney General Alberto Gonzales told The Daily Beast that he "would have instructed the Justice Department [[To]] pursue justice 
without making a political mess." 
Film director Roman Polanski is not the only convicted pedophile [[To]] walk free this month and return [[To]] a life of privilege. On Wednesday, 
hedge fund manager [[Jeffrey]] [[Epstein]] completes his one[[-]]year house arrest in Palm Beach, which has been even less arduous than Polanski's 
time at a Swiss ski chalet.

During [[Epstein]]'s term of "house arrest," he made several trips each month [[To]] his New York home and his private Caribbean island. In the 
earlier stage of his sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor[[-]]13 months in the Palm Beach Stockade—he was allowed out [[To]] his 
office each day. Meanwhile, [[Epstein]] has settled more than a dozen lawsuits brought by the underage [[Girls]] who were recruited [[To]] perform 
"massages" at his Palm Beach mansion. Seven victims reached a last[[-]]minute deal last week, days before a scheduled trial; each received 
well over $[[1]] million—an amount that will hardly dent [[Epstein]]'s $2 billion net worth.

With that, the known victims of [[Epstein]]'s sexual compulsion have been officially silenced, and the case against him is closed unless new 
ones come forward. According [[To]] banking et[[-]]Inn[[-]]pc he ha c heen mnvina accetc niit nf the T IS and may well follow Pnlanclri intn

luxurious exile. 
But the question remains: Did [[Epstein]]'s wealth and social connections—former President Bill Clinton; Prince Andrew; former Israeli 
Prime Minister [[Ehud Barak]]; New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson; and former Treasury Secretary [[Larry]] [[Summers]] were just a few of the 
prominent passengers on his private jets—allow him [[To]] receive only a slap on the wrist for crimes that carry a mandatory 20[[-]]year 
sentence? Was he able, with his limitless assets and heavy[[-]]hitting lawyers—[[Alan]] Dershowitz, Gerald Lefcourt, [[Roy Black]], Kenneth [[Starr]], 
Guy Lewis, and Martin Weinberger among them—[[To]] escape equal justice? 
[[Epstein]] Faces Sex[[-]]Traffic Probe 
http://www.thedailyb...obref=obnetwork 
The Justice Denartment is investigating [[Jeffrey]] Enstein for child trafficking The Daily Beast has learned—and has widened the scone n 
its probe [[To]] include a famous modeling agency. 
Hedge[[-]]fund manager [[Jeffrey]] [[Epstein]] completed his sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor last week. But it appears his problems 
may not be over. Now The Daily Beast has learned that: 
• Federal investigators continue [[To]] investigate [[Epstein]]'s activities, [[To]] see whether there is evidence of child trafficking—a far more serious 
charge than the two in his non[[-]]prosecution agreement, the arrangement between [[Epstein]] and the Depat___Intent of Justice allowing him [[To]] 
nlearl cmiltv [[To]] lnwer[[-]]level ctate rrimec Trafficking can ran[[-]]v a 911[[-]]vear centenre 
• The FF1T is also investigating Enstein's friend Jean T tic flninel whose MC2 modeling agency annears [[To]] have been a source of [[Girls]] [[From]] 
'-
overseas who ended up on [[Epstein]]'s private jets. 
D 
Because [[Epstein]]'s predatory habits stretch back many years and involved dozens of young[[-]]looking [[Girls]], there may well be more evidence 
[[To]] uncover. 
Under the concept of double ieopardy, [[Epstein]] can no longer be prosecuted for any of the charges covered by his non[[-]]prosecution 
agreement, in which he agreed [[To]] serve a short term of incarceration, fund the civil suits of named victims, and register as a sex offender. 
The victims who accepted cash settlements in these civil suits agreed not [[To]] 
testifyagainst him or speak publicly about the case. However, 
- 
new evidence developed by the Depal___Intent of Justice on other offenses not covered by the agreement, 
victims who come forward, could lead [[To]] new charges. There is no statute of limitations in the federal sex[[-]]trafficking law, which was also 
enacted by the state of Florida in 2002. Because his predatory habits stretch back many years and involved dozens of young[[-]]looking [[Girls]], 
there may well be more evidence [[To]] uncover. (Several young women who claim [[To]] be [[Epstein]] victims have recently contacted a Ft. 
Lauderdale lawyer, but [[To]] [[Date]] no new civil complaints have been filed.) 
including allegations by additional

• Billionaire Pedophile Goes Free 
These new developments come one week after the publication of two articles in The Daily Beast about [[Epstein]]'s pattern of sexual contact 
with underage [[Girls]], which Palm Beach police began investigating in 2005 and the U.S. Attorney's office then settled in a 2007 plea deal. 
The first article quoted a deposition by then[[-]]Palm Beach Chief of Police [[Michael]] Reiter, in which he stated that [[Epstein]], a billionaire with 
many powerful friends, had received special treatment in both his plea deal and the terms of his incarceration. Although federal 
investigators at one point produced a draft 53[[-]]page indictment against [[Epstein]], he was eventually allowed [[To]] plead guilty [[To]] only two 
relatively minor state charges and receive a short term of incarceration: 13 months in the county jail, during which he went [[To]] the office 
every day, and one year of community control, during which he traveled frequently [[To]] New York and his private island in the Virgin 
Islands. 
The Daily Beast has now discovered another instance in which [[Epstein]] apparently received special consideration: As a convicted sex 
offender, he is required by law [[To]] undergo an impartial psychological evaluation prior [[To]] sentencing and [[To]] receive psychiatric treatment 
during and after incarceration. This is because child molesters tend [[To]] be repeat offenders with high rates of recidivism. According [[To]] a 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029626 
source in law enforcement, however, [[Epstein]] was allowed [[To]] submit a report by his private psychologist, Dr. [[Stephen Alexander]] of Palm 
Beach, Florida, whose phone has since been disconnected with no forwarding information. 
The Daily Beast's second article provided details about [[Epstein]]'s systematic abuse of underage [[Girls]] at his Palm Beach mansion, where 
members of his staff allegedly recruited and paid a parade of teenagers, most of them 16 or younger, [[To]] perform daily massages that 
devolved into masturbation, groping, and sometimes full[[-]]blown sexual contact. It also revealed a monetary relationship between [[Epstein]] 
and [[Jean Luc Brunel]], a frequent visitor [[To]] whom he gave $[[1]] million around the same time that Brunel was starting his MC2 modeling 
agency. Some of the young [[Girls]] MC2 recruited [[From]] overseas—often [[From]] Eastern Europe and South America—are known [[To]] have been 
passengers on [[Epstein]]'s private jets. 
The U.S. Attorney General's Office in Florida says that it is against policy [[To]] confirm or deny the existence of an investigation. [[Jeffrey]] 
[[Epstein]]'s lawyer, [[Jack Goldberger]], says he has no knowledge of an ongoing probe, and he told The Daily Beast, "[[Jeffrey]] [[Epstein]] has fully 
complied with all state and federal requirements that arise [[From]] the prior proceedings in Palm Beach. There are no pending civil lawsuits. 
There are not and should not be any pending criminal investigations, given Mr. [[Epstein]]'s complete fulfillment of all the terms of his non-
prosecution agreement with the federal government."
