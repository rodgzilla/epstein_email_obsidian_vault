Saying nothing is reputational suicide. Even if. is discredited by people will know JE paid her off and 
believe G was complicate absent a credible denial. 
Now it is reported that G engaged in direct abuse - as I feared would happen. Next reports to the authorities will 
be made. 
It is necessary from a litigation, investigatory and reputational reason to issue a cogent denial. 
I can see why JE doesn't want this as it may not suit him but he is already toast.
