Transcript: Phone call between President 
Trump and journalist Bob Woodward 
Aaron Blake 
President Trump and Bob Woodward discuss Woodward's new book, "Fear," before its 
publication. (The Washington Post) 
Bob Woodward, an associate editor at The Washington Post, sought an interview with 
President Trump as he was writing "Fear," a book about Trump's presidency. Trump 
called Woodward in early August, after the manuscript had been completed, [[To]] say he 
wanted [[To]] participate. 
Over the course of 11[[-]]plus minutes, Trump repeatedly claimed his White House staff 
hadn't informed him of Woodward's interview request — despite also admitting Sen. 
Lindsey Graham (R[[-]]S.C.) had told him Woodward wanted [[To]] talk. He also started the 
phone call by saying Woodward had "always been fair" [[To]] him, but by the end he said 
the book would be "inaccurate." 
This is a transcript of that call, with key sections highlighted and annotated. [[To]] see an

Trump: Hello, Bob. 
BW: President Trump, how are you? 
Trump: How are you? How are you doing? Okay? 
BW: Real well. [[I]]'m turning on my tape recorder, with your permission. 
Trump: Oh, that's okay. That's okay. [[I]] don't mind that at all. 
BW: [[I]]'m sorry we missed the opportunity [[To]] talk for the book. 
Trump: Well, [[I]] just spoke with Kellyanne [Conway] and she asked me if [[I]] got a call. [[I]] 
never got a call. [[I]] never got a message. Who did you ask about speaking [[To]] me? 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 033316 
BW: Well, about six people. 
Trump: They don't tell me. 
BW: A senator. [[I]] talked [[To]] Kellyanne about it two and a half months ago. 
Trump: [[[1]]. 
BW: She came for lunch. 
Trump: Well, it's too bad. Of course, you and [[I]] had a conversation a couple of years ago, 
and so that [[I]] think got you there a little bit. And we had a conversation many years ago, if 
you remember, in Trump Tower. 
BW: Yeah, [[I]] do. 
Trump: That has [[To]] be 20 years ago. And you were thinking about doing a book about me 
then, which is interesting. Who knew it would've been on this [[Subject]]? Right? That was not 
in the cards at that time. 
BW: That's right. Well, [[I]]'m sorry, [[I]]... 
Trump: [[I]] still remember that. 
BW: [[I]] spent a lot of time on this, talked [[To]] lots of people. 
Trump: All right. Good. 
BW: And as you know and are living, we are at a pivot point in history. 
Trump: Right. 
BW: And [[I]] would've liked [[To]] have done that, and [[I]] maximized my effort, and somehow it 
didn't get [[To]] you, or... 
Trump: It's really too bad, because nobody told me about it, and [[I]] would've loved [[To]] have 
spoken [[To]] you. You know [[I]]'m very open [[To]] you. [[I]] think you've always been fair. We'll see 
what happens. But all [[I]] can say is the country is doing very well. We're doing better 
economically just about than at any time. We're doing better on unemployment maybe than 
ever. You know, [[I]] mean, if you look at the unemployment numbers, you've heard me say it. 
And we're doing better on unemployment than just about ever. We're having a lot of___a lot 
of companies are moving back into our country, which would've been unheard of two years 
ago. If the other administration or representatives of it had kept going, had kept___you 
know, if the other group had won, [[I]] will tell you, that you would have, [[I]] think you'd have a 
GDP of less than zero. [[I]] think we would've been going in the wrong direction. Because 
regulations are such a big part of what we've done, Bob. 
BW: Well, [[I]] understand that point of view. And as you know, it's also a difficult time where 
the political system and you and my business is being tested. 
Trump: Yeah. Yeah. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 033317 
BW: [[I]] take it very seriously. [[I]]'ve done books on eight presidents, going back [[From]] Nixon [[To]] 
Obama. 
Trump: Right. 
BW: And [[I]] learned something about reporting, frankly, Mr. President. 
Trump: Good. 
BW: [[I]]'ve got [[To]] go talk [[To]] people and see them outside of the White House and outside of 
their offices, and gained a lot of insight and documentation. And it's___you know, it's a 
tough look at the world and your administration and you. 
Trump: Right. Well, [[I]] assume that means it's going [[To]] be a negative book. But you know, 
[[I]]'m some___I'm sort of 50 percent used [[To]] that. [Laughter] That's all right. Some are good 
and some are bad. Sounds like this is going [[To]] be a bad one. 
BW: It was a chance missed, and [[I]] don't know how things work over there in terms of... 
Trump: Very well. We... 
BW: ... getting [[To]] you. 
Trump: Well, if you would call Madeleine [Westerhout] in my office ... Did you speak [[To]] 
Madeleine? 
BW: No, [[I]] didn't. But [[I]]... 
Trump: Madeleine is the key. She's the secret. Because she's the person ... 
BW: Well, [[I]] talked [[To]] Raj [Shah] about it. [[I]] talked [[To]] ... [[I]] talked [[To]] Kellyanne. 
Trump: Well, a lot of them are afraid [[To]] come and talk, or___you know, they are busy. [[I]]'m 
busy. But [[I]] don't mind talking [[To]] you. [[I]] would've spoken [[To]] you. [[I]] spoke [[To]] you 20 years 
[ago] and [[I]] spoke [[To]] you a year and a half or two years ago. 
[Listen [[To]] Woodward and Trump's call on The Post's "Can He Do That?" podcast] 
BW: A couple of years ago, [[I]] understand. 
Trump: And [[I]] certainly don't mind talking [[To]] you, and [[I]] wish [[I]] could've spoken [[To]] you. But 
nobody called my office. [[I]] mean, you went through, [[I]] guess, different people.... 
BW: Well, Mr. President, how can [[I]] spend all this time talking [[To]] people and___like 
Kellyanne and Raj and Republican senators? 
Trump: Who were the senators? No, they never called me about it. 
BW: Senator [Lindsey] Graham said he had talked [[To]] you about talking [[To]] me. Now, is that 
not true? 
Trump: Senator Graham actually mentioned it quickly in one meeting. 
BW: [[Yes]]. Well, see. And then nothing happened. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 033318 
Trump: That is true. That is true. Well, that____no, but that is true. Mentioned it quickly, not 
like, you know, and [[I]] would certainly have thought that maybe you would've called the 
office. But that's okay. [[I]]'ll speak [[To]] Kellyanne. [[I]] am a little surprised that she wouldn't have 
told me. In fact, she just walked in. [[[To]] Kellyanne] [[I]]'m talking [[To]] Bob Woodward. He said 
that he told you. 
Conway: [[Yes]]. 
Trump: About speaking [[To]] me. But you never told me. Why didn't you tell me? 
Conway: [inaudible]. 
Trump: [[I]] would've been very happy [[To]] speak [[To]] him. All right, so what are you going [[To]] do? 
BW: Well ... 
Trump: So [[I]] have another bad book coming out. Big deal. 
BW: ... it goes on, and [[I]]... What you can count on is that [[I]]'ve been very careful. And 
Evelyn, are you on? 
EMD: [[Yes]]. 
BW: Evelyn Duffy, who's my assistant, Mr. President. 
Trump: Hello, Evelyn. 
BW: She transcribed all the tapes because, with permission, [[I]] taped people for hundreds of 
hours. 
Trump: Good. 
BW: And [[I]] think there's nothing in this book that doesn't come [[From]] a firsthand source. Is 
that correct, Evelyn? 
EMD: [[I]] believe that's 
Trump: But are you naming names? Or do you just say sources? 
BW: Yeah, well, it names real incidents, so ... 
Trump: No, but do you name sources? [[I]] mean, are you naming the people, or just say, 
people have said? 
BW: [[I]] say, at 2:00 on this day, the following happened, and everyone who's there, including 
yourself, is quoted. And [[I]]'m sorry [[I]] didn't get [[To]] ask you about these ... 
Trump: [[I]] mean, you do know [[I]]'m doing a great job for the country. You do know that 
NATO now is going [[To]] pay billions and billions of dollars more, as an example, than 
anybody thought possible, that other presidents were unable [[To]] get more? And it was heading 
downward. You do know all of the things [[I]]'ve done and things that [[I]]'m doing? [[I]]'m in the 
process of making some of the greatest trade deals ever [[To]] be made. You do understand that 
stuff? [[I]] mean, [[I]] hope. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 033319 
BW: Certainly, [[I]] understand and [[I]] would've loved [[To]] go through a discussion with you about 
NATO, because this goes back [[To]] early in your administration and your concern about it, and 
the agreement that the countries have that they would increase their defense contribution, 
what is it, by the year 2024? And you know . .. So anyway, we are ... 
Trump: Well, you know last year, if you see the secretary, [Jens] Stoltenberg, he said [[I]] 
believe $44 billion just last year, and that was [[From]] last year's meeting. And this year it's 
much more money they've agreed [[To]] put up. So it's a tremendous amount of money. No 
other president has done it. It was heading down in the opposite direction. So [[I]] don't know if 
you're going [[To]] report it that way; probably not. But that's too bad, but that's all right, but 
you know, one of those things. 
BW: Everything is going [[To]] be factual. And it is not a good thing for my business, if [[I]] may 
say this [[To]] you, Mr. President, [[To]] the presidency, or [[To]] the country, [[To]] not have real, full 
exchanges on these. And [[I]] broke my spear on it trying [[To]] get [[To]] you. 
Trump: Well, other than Lindsey [Graham], who did quickly mention it, nobody mentioned 
it. 
BW: You say Kellyanne's there, ask her. 
Trump: Nobody told me about it. Well, let me ask her. Why don't you speak [[To]] Kellyanne. 
Ask her. She never told me about it. 
[Conway takes the phone.] 
BW: Kellyanne? 
Conway: Bob, how are you? Hi. 
BW: Hi. Remember two and a half months ago you came over and [[I]] laid out, [[I]] wanted [[To]] 
talk [[To]] the president? And you said you would get back [[To]] me? 
Conway: [[I]] do. And [[I]] put in the request. But you know, they___it was rejected. [[I]] can only 
take it so far. [[I]] guess [[I]] can bring it right [[To]] the president next time. 
BW: Yeah. 
Conway: But [[I]] try [[To]] follow all the protocols, or else [[I]]'m accused of being somebody who 
doesn't follow protocol. 
BW: President Trump, [[I]] just want you [[To]] know [[I]] made every effort. 
Conway: But you had talked [[To]] [former White House communications director] Hope 
[Hicks], right, who said no? 
BW: Listen, [[I]] talked [[To]] anyone [[I]] could. [Laughs] 
Conway: You talked [[To]] a number of people and they all said no? 
BW: [[I]] talked [[To]] Raj. 
Conway: Raj. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 033320 
BW: He was going [[To]] work it out. 
Conway: Hope. IMe?]. 
[The president says something in the background that is inaudible.] 
Conway: [[I]] said you tried talking [[To]] everybody? What about when you interviewed, like, 
other people? They all said [[Yes]]? That they'd try? 
BW: Yeah, well, about six or seven people. [[I]] tried. And [[I]] couldn't have___you and [[I]] spent a 
whole lunch on it, Kellyanne. And [[I]] said, [[I]] want [[To]] cover the substantive issues in foreign 
policy and domestic policy. And you said you would get back [[To]] me. Nothing. 
Conway: Yeah. So, [[I]] did. [[I]] presented it [[To]] the people here who make those decisions, but ... 
BW: Who are the people? 
Conway: But anyway, [[I]]'ll give you back [[To]] the president. And [[I]]'m glad [[To]] hear that you 
tried through seven or eight different people. That's good. You should tell him all the names. 
[Laughs] Thank you. 
Trump: But you never called for me. It would've been nice, Bob, if you called for me, in 
my office. [[I]] mean, [[I]] have a secretary. [[I]] have two, three secretaries. If you would've called 
directly___a lot of people are afraid ... Raj, [[I]] hardly have ... [[I]] don't speak [[To]] Raj. 
BW: Kellyanne is a... 
Trump: [[I]] do, [[I]] do, and Kellyanne went [[To]] somebody, but she didn't come [[To]] me. 
BW: Well, does she have access [[To]] you? 
Trump: And she should've come [[To]] me. She does have access [[To]] me. Absolutely. She has 
direct access, but she didn't come [[To]] me. And you know what? That's okay. [[I]]'ll just end up 
with another bad book. What can [[I]] tell you? 
BW: It's surprising [[To]] me that these people___did Raj have access [[To]] you? 
Trump: Not really, but he would've been able [[To]] do it. But [[I]] have an office. You have the 
office number. [[I]] have an office that's directly into my office. 
Conway: [inaudible in background] 
Trump: It doesn't matter. Let me tell you what matters: The economy is the best it's been in 
many, many decades. And it's going [[To]] get a lot better. And the country is doing very well. 
That's what's important. 
BW: [[Yes]], sir. [[I]] thought [[I]] would ... 
Trump: We're doing a good job. 
BW: ... never kind of say, let's not talk about this because the book is done [[To]] a president 
Trump: Yeah, [[I]] know. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 033321 
BW: ... and, but that's the position we're in. And it's one [[I]] tried [[To]] avoid. You need [[To]] 
know [[I]] made maximum effort. 
Trump: All right. It's too bad. 
BW: [[Yes]], sir. 
Trump: [[I]]'m just hearing about it. And [[I]] heard___I did hear [[From]] Lindsey, but [[I]]'m just 
hearing about it. So we're going [[To]] have a very inaccurate book, and that's too bad. But [[I]] 
don't blame you entirely. 
BW: No, it's r] ____ it's going [[To]] be accurate, [[I]] promise. 
Trump: Yeah, okay. Well, accurate is that nobody's ever done a better job than [[I]]'m doing 
as president. That [[I]] can tell you. So that's ... And that's the way a lot of people feel that 
know what's going on, and you'll see that over the years. But a lot of people feel that, Bob. 
BW: [[I]] believe in our country, and because you're our president, [[I]] wish you good luck. 
Trump: Okay. Thank you very much, Bob. [[I]] appreciate it. Bye.
