i spoke with Janusz and he was agreeable and happy to stay on and continue working for you 
his wife is still working for trump but that will be short term and she will then look for new work 
if janusz still works for you he plans to live on the property with his wife 
please advise if i should reinstate his employment and if so as of what date?
