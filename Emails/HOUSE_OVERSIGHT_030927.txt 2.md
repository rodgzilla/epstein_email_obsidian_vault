Broward Probe: 302 Reasons Not [[To]] Talk [[To]] The [[Fbi]] 
BY SAM FIELDS 
Guest Columnist 
Actually, there are not 302 reasons. There is but one and it is called in federal court "The 302". It 
could screw the innocent and the unwary. 
The newspapers and Browardbeat.[[Com]] make clear that the Federal investigations that led [[To]] the arrests 
of County Commissioner Josephus Eggleston, former Miramar Commissioner Fitzroy Salesman and 
School Board member Bev Gallagher are just beginning. 
The [[Fbi]] will be interviewing everyone [[From]] County Administrator Bertha Henry [[To]] bus drivers about 
anything and everything. 
They are looking for scalps. 
[[I]] suspect that if the average person thought about it, he would assume that when the [[Fbi]] comes calling, 
like Joe Friday [[From]] DRAGNET, they ""want the facts and nothing but the facts." Equally important 
they want an accurate record of that interview so they bring a court reporter or at the very least a tape 
recorder. 
The average person would be wrong. 
Agents bring a pencil and pad [[To]] take notes. They then prepare a summary of the interview called a 
"302 Report." 
If you are called as a witness at trial, prior [[To]] testifying, you will be given a copy of "Your 302" [[To]] 
review. It is a record of what the [[Fbi]] insists you said at your previous meeting. 
If your interview lasted more than thirty seconds, it is guaranteed.you will fmd numerous discrepancies. 
Some of them will be insignificant; some of them could be material. 
Ask two people [[To]] listen [[To]] you in a discussion about a traffic accident and then write a summary. It is a 
guaranteed they will have differences with each other as well as with you, the witness.

You said, ""[[I]] am reasonably sure that the traffic light was green". 
One report takes out the equivocation and quotes you as saying: "The light was green." 
This brings us [[To]] Federal law 18 USC 1001. That statute makes it a felony [[To]] lie [[To]] the government. And 
guess who decides whether or not you were lying? The government. 
So here is your conundrum. Do you testify about your doubts about the light, which is the truth, or do 
you adopt the "302"" version [[To]] avoid the wrath of the [[Fbi]]? 
Whether or not the "302" discrepancies are a result of stupidity or cupidity makes no difference. 
Testify in opposition [[To]] the "302" and you are in the crosshairs of the Feds. 
If they believe your testimony cost them the case, the next thing you likely [[To]] hear [[From]] the [[Fbi]] will be: 
"Please place your hands behind your back." 
A number of years ago, fed up with the 302 Two Step, [[I]] turned the tables on them. 
In a high profile case, my client was asked [[To]] submit [[To]] an [[Fbi]] interview at their offices in North [[Miami]] 
Beach. 
Feigning naivety, [[I]] asked where the court reporter was. [[I]] was told there was no court reporter. 
[[I]] then asked where the tape recorder was. 
[[I]] will always be impressed that the agent was able [[To]] give us the response he did without laughing. He 
said the [[Fbi]] could not tape the interview because they did not have "enough money in their budget." 
It was time [[To]] play the Trump Card. 
At that point, [[I]] removed a cassette recorder [[From]] my pocket and explained that my client had been able 
[[To]] scrape together the 59 cents for a cassette tape. Further we would pay for the tape [[To]] be transcribed 
and supply them with a free copy of everything. 
You could've heard a fart in a vacuum. 
They now made it clear that no way, no how would any [[Fbi]] interview be recorded. So we went forward 
with the interview as the agent took notes. 
Months later the client was called [[To]] testify at trial. 
[[I]] warned him the "302" would be a work of fiction. It was. [[I]] was sitting in the back of the courtroom. 
Called [[To]] the stand, he told the "real" truth and not the "302" version of the truth. The Assistant U.S. 
Attorney was frustrated and kept on confronting him with the "302" version.

Fed up with the prosecutor and in the presence of the jury, the witness preceded [[To]] recount my debate 
over recording [[From]] the first interview. Pointing [[To]] me in the back of the courtroom, the witness 
announced that [[I]] had warned him that they would pull this crap with the ""302"" report 
It didn't take the jury very long [[To]] acquit. 
With the advent of DNA and groups like the Innocence Project, we have now seen that so[[-]]called 
unrecorded confessions have put many innocent people in jail and even on Death Row. As a result, 
agencies such as the BSO, now require all interviews [[To]] be taped. 
But not the [[Fbi]]. 
Like anyone, including lawyers, the [[Fbi]] wants [[To]] control the record of the interview. Taping hurts that 
effort. 
[[I]]'m not saying that it is [[Fbi]] policy [[To]] step over the line. But they have chalk on their shoes more often 
than you can imagine. 
So, what's should you do if the [[Fbi]] comes calling? 
First of all, the advice [[I]] am about [[To]] give is not for the a guy who was an inadvertent witness [[To]] a bank 
robbery. 
[[I]] am talking about people who are being interviewed as part of the types of crimes that are best 
described as corruption, RICO, white collar, etc. 
Those are the kinds of cases that involve tons of evidence. Giving an innocent, but incorrect answer [[To]] a 
vague question could leave any of us in deep CaCa. 
A case in point is the lead story in the September 26, 2009 Herald. Chris Walton, director of the 
Broward County Transportation Department, was interviewed by two [[Fbi]] agents. 
He stated that they wanted [[To]] know if "commissioners attempted [[To]] influence contracts." 
"[[I]] told them no." 
It may sound like a simple straight forward Q[[-]]and[[-]]A but it ain't necessarily so. He may think his 
interview and public statement ends the matter. 
In actuality, he has thrown down the gauntlet in front of the [[Fbi]]. 
Start out with the understanding that the [[Fbi]] is not investigating [[To]] see if there is crime and corruption in 
Broward County government. They already believe there is. They are only trying [[To]] uncover evidence [[To]] 
confirm their beliefs.

Walton's blanket defense of the Commission has made the Feds conclude he is a fool or co[[-]]conspirator. 
The [[Fbi]] just needs the evidence and not much of it. [[To]] quote the late Supreme Court Justice William 
Brennan: "any prosecutor worth his salt could indict a ham sandwich." 
This means all evidence, regardless of its ambiguous nature, will be interpreted [[To]] support their 
assumption of wrongdoing. 
They will be using software [[To]] go through millions of E[[-]]mail messages [[To]] look for key words. As Buddy 
has quoted me: "The 'F in E[[-]]mail stands for evidence."" 
So imagine the following scenario. 
Six months [[From]] now they uncover an E[[-]]mail [[From]] the County Manager [[To]] Walton stating that 
Commissioner X wants [[To]] know if the bid of company Y for new busses was correctly filled out. He 
replies that it was. 
Months later he has totally forgotten about the innocuous E[[-]]mail. Based on the merits, he happens [[To]] 
rank Y's bid number one. 
You can bet as sure as [[J]]. Edgar Hoover wore [[Pink]] poodle skirts, the [[Fbi]] will conclude this was code 
[[From]] Commissioner X [[To]] Walton [[To]] vote for Y. 
Armed with the E[[-]]mail you can be damn sure that the G[[-]]Men will be back threatening him with 
everything including a stint in Gitmo. 
All of this might have been avoided if he had followed my three basic rules. 
Memorize them. 
[[1]]. Do not talk [[To]] the [[Fbi]] without a lawyer. 
2. Do not talk [[To]] the [[Fbi]] without a lawyer. 
3. Do not talk [[To]] the [[Fbi]] without a law
