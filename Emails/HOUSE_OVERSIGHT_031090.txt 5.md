Rod Blagojevich is the former Illinois Governor who tried to sell Obama's seat in congress. 
Obama was asked, by the press, if he had ever met Gov. Ron Blagojevich. 
Barack Obama: "I only saw Rod Blagojevich one time ... and that was in the stands and from

a distance at a Chicago Bears Football Game."

To understand the next 4 years, you have to understand the world according to Chicago ... 
While Chicago is a city in Illinois , it is almost a completely different country when 
it comes to politics, with a whole different set of morals and language. 
There are only three rules and a Prime Directive which anybody can understand. You don't 
even need an attorney to understand them --and if you need an attorney, well, you know too 
much...so look out for Rule #3! 
RULE #1...No matter what you see, hear, or do --you don't know anybody and you don't 
know nothing! 
RULE #2...If you capture something on tape or camera -- it doesn't reveal nothing! 
RULE #3...If you know what everybody knows in Chicago --well, you still don't know 
nothing. 
The PRIME DIRECTIVE in CHICAGO ...No matter what the vote Democrats win 
the election. Now pay close attention! 
It's very simple....we'll illustrate. Remember, you know nothing. 
These two? They don't know each other! They said they didn't.

The fellas in this picture. They never actually met face to face. What fellas? We don't see 
nothing! 
The guy on the left? For all you know he's Santa Claus. 
And the guy on the right.., well, he's the Easter Bunny! That's all you need to know. 
Go to your eye doctor...your eyes are lying to you! Ca'pish? 
Remember Jimmy Hoffa? He knew too much and now, well, now no one knows where 
he is. 
Is the big picture clear? Not these pictures! Remember, You've already forgot them...

Now, ain't that simple? They don't know each other and they never met! 
How is that possible? 'cause they said so! And don't forget it! 
P.S. If you pass this on to your friends, don't forget, you know nothing and they will 
know nothing.
