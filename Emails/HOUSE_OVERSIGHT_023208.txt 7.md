Leon please read the attached proposed response to the IRS , see if you can understand it !!!. lye asked 
for a re-do. and given prelimiary directions to Alan to have it edited over the weekend 
. If you are quarterbacking ,ok with me. just please let everyone know. you must deal with the 
outrageous incompetence in your family office.. Alans words " but I was told that.., but I was told by 
the office (sic) that ... , BUT i was told by joslin,. , but I was told by. " why is leon blaming me for .." . 
I ye have always given you my best advice, If you reflect on your financial life, you have been kept safe, 
had remarkable results and no disasters. I have repeatedly urged you to get rid of the people in your 
office. , you have repeatedly chosen to ignore my advice , you told me last week that the emotional 
reason was in order to be weaned off my group and not have to pay my high fees. ( though ignoring 
the benefit of between 1.5 and 2b to the better. ) . and no explosions. You have email after email 
,where i remind you that I am not your bookkeeper or accountant ( in brads corporate speak his" finance 
dept ??!!) that it should be redone .I have reviewed a multitude of the silly reports given to you and 
have pointed out the continued numerous inaccuracies. your question" so what if the numbers are off, 
so what if the categories are off. whats the big deal??. I suggest you de risk you fmances and make the 
tough decisions necessary - pay the right amounts ( high) to get the work done properly or , you are, Im 
afraid, certain to get an unhappy answer.. tom will be back from vacation, this week.
