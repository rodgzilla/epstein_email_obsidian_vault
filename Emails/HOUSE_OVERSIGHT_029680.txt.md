it is a scam.. what they will' tell you is the only thing they want is a vehicle and a bank acct and that you have 
no risk in setting it up. if the money doesn't come in , you lose nothing„ afterwards howver they use all the 
info you provide [[To]] try [[To]] defraud other people, saying, see , the govt of the maldives is our client and for only 
250 k , we can get you a piece of the action. there is a treasury fraud site , at the us treasury web page, . very 
similar deals.

[[Jeffrey]], 
Need your advice. 
My finance minister is telling me that he has an anonymous funds manager who is willing [[To]] deposit 4 billion 
dollars in Maldives and that they are willing [[To]] lend a percentage of that in exchange for government 
promissory notes. The 4 billion would be deposited in the Central Bank. But they want us [[To]] set up a special 
purpose vehicle, a construction company fully owned by the government [[To]] receive the loan. Such a company 
can only be set up under a presidential decree. 
[[I]] am also told that the funds manager would be charging Maldives upfront a certain percentage of the amount 
lent. 
[[I]] don't feel [[I]] have enough information on this. [[I]] don't know who is this funds manager. They always want the 
finance minister [[To]] meet them in Bangkok or some place outside. Why would anyone want [[To]] deposit such a 
large amount here when we don't have a credit rating and public debt is so high. [[I]] feel very uncomfortable 
about this. 
What do you think [[I]] should do. [[I]] am very uncomfortable. In addition [[To]] the finance minister, a leading 
politician and leader of the coalition parliamentary group is behind it. He could be my leading contender for 
presidency. 
Does this sound all ridiculous [[To]] you. [[I]] have a strange feeling about this whole thing. 
Best regards 
Waheed
