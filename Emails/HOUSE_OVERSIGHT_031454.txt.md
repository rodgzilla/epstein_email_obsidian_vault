Plus: look at these lies! 
In response to a message left seeking the Trump campaign's comment on this article, on 
Thursday Trump's general counsel Alan Garten emailed threatening legal action against 
BuzzFeed News. "Mr. Trump's only connection with Mr. Epstein was that Mr. Epstein was 
one of thousands of people who has visited Mar-a-Lago. That's it. Mr. Trump has NEVER 
been accused of having any involvement or even having any knowledge of any of Mr. 
Epstein's conduct by anyone," Garten wrote. 
"As a result, I have no idea what the purpose of your article could possibly be other than to 
try and intentionally and with actual malice defame my client's name and reputation by 
mentioning him in the same article as Mr. Epstein. In other words, suggest guilt by 
association. This is the very definition of irresponsible and reckless journalism and to 
publish such a story would be highly unethical - even by buzzfeed's standards."
