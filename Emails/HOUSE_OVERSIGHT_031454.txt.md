Plus: look at these lies! 
In response [[To]] a message left seeking the Trump campaign's comment on this article, on 
Thursday Trump's general counsel [[Alan]] Garten emailed threatening legal action against 
BuzzFeed News. "Mr. Trump's only connection with Mr. [[Epstein]] was that Mr. [[Epstein]] was 
one of thousands of people who has visited Mar[[-]]a[[-]]Lago. That's it. Mr. Trump has NEVER 
been accused of having any involvement or even having any knowledge of any of Mr. 
[[Epstein]]'s conduct by anyone," Garten [[Wrote]]. 
"As a result, [[I]] have no idea what the purpose of your article could possibly be other than [[To]] 
try and intentionally and with actual malice defame my client's name and reputation by 
mentioning him in the same article as Mr. [[Epstein]]. In other words, suggest guilt by 
association. This is the very definition of irresponsible and reckless journalism and [[To]] 
publish such a story would be highly unethical - even by buzzfeed's standards."
