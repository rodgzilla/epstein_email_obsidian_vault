Alexandra, 
I have not been able to respond to your questions because Mr. Epstein is traveling. 
But if you plan to make any factual assertions about him in your article, I hope you will run the facts 
by me, as you said yesterday you would do. 
Mr. Epstein has been the subject of many inaccurate and misleading articles, and I am sure Newsweek would 
not want to make such a mistake or worse, libel him. 
Best, 
Jay
