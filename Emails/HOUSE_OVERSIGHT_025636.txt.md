When I was with him yesterday I told him we were going to caribbean and he asked where.. He has an island in 
bahamas, making you two the only people I know who own islands..:) will ask him if he is free then. He is 
remarkable in new movie, though the film itself is not fantastic.. he is also a pretty good guitarist., his show 
with alice cooper and joe perry in la was great.
