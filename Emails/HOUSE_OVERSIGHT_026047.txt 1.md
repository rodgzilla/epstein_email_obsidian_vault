So What Does Pizzagate Have To Do With President Bill Clinton? 
President Clinton's involvement in Pizzagate has been peripheral until now, but the scandal is opening closets 
that both Bill and Hillary Clinton would have wished stayed closed. However, last month, the Guardian 
reported that during the second presidential debate, Donald Trump brought along four women who have 
accused Bill Clinton of sex crimes, including rape. 
The U.K. broadsheet surmised that this was an attempt by Trump to deflect from allegations of misogyny and 
sexual misconduct by Trump himself As time has passed, the specter of billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein 
has re-emerged. It is perhaps Clinton's relationship with Epstein that has the greatest bearing on Pizzagate.
