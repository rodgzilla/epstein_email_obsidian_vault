> interview with (formerly known as Jane 
> Doe #3), portions of which are very likely to be airing on 
> Good Morning America and other ABC programs this week. We would like to offer you an opportunity 
> to respond to the allegations she has raised about Mr. 
> Epstein. Can you tell me who among you I should be in contact 
> with? Should you wish to make a statement or respond in 
> any other manner - I will need it by close-of-business 
> Wednesday. Thanks kindly,James Hill James
