Agree! 'Get It Right' is singular priority - we think alike. This is the Role and Importance of pre[[-]]production. 
Funds adequate. 
Clarity critical, as is charisma. However, given intimacy of TV interviews, it's not always apparent upfront who 
communicates well. Usually by not always. Sometimes someone who is a great lecturer [[To]] 500 students falls flat 
or off puts as arrogant. Sometimes a mousey introvert with intense eye and facial expressions sparkles and 
radiates. There is no substitute, however, for clarity. 
Looking forward [[To]] discussion.
