It's not too late to buy financials as a medium term trade. They've run up a lot this week but we're getting 
endless calls from generalists asking which banks to buy — there is still more upside to the sector. Banks also 
provide some offset to your bonds if interest rates continue to move. Our financials sector specialist thinks XLF 
could have another 20-25% upside given its many levers to the Trump trade: less regulation, higher interest 
rates/steeper yield curve, higher vol, economic growth, etc. The regional banks are asset sensitive and more of a 
pure play on a rates move but we view the larger cap banks as having even more upside to the Trump Trade 
given the above points. 
Buy an XLF 17March2017 call spread: 
• Buy the 105% call / sell a 110% call with a 115% at-expiry knock-in 
• Total premium: 1.75% 
All eyes are on Sunday's 60 Minutes interview with Trump. Market is pricing that all regulations will be rolled 
back (very optimistic). Any hint that this is not true could lead to pullback on Monday. 
Note on tech: we're seeing FANG used as a source of funds with the rotation from growth into value. There's 
also the tax read-through: tech is already relatively tax advantaged @ 22%; Industrials are at 30%, Financials at 
29%. Next year, tech could benefit from a repatriation tax holiday but that is viewed as more of a Q1/Q2 trade. 
More thoughts on financials: 
With respect to the economy, the market is certainly indicating that there will be a large fiscal stimulus which 
may send US growth higher and that's a good thing for financials for a wide variety of reasons, from 
employment to wages to loan growth and credit quality (even if somewhat offset by higher rates). It does 
remain to be seen exactly how much of this expected policy actually gets done, but at the moment, investors are 
willing to take a certain amount of growth on faith. 
So those are positives for financials before we even discuss regulation. The move in the financials since the 
election would seem to indicate that investors have concluded that nearly every piece of financial regulation 
will get put into a shredder on day one of the new administration. The incoming administration has fueled that 
with comments about rolling back pieces (or more) of Dodd-Frank in particular. I can see making the case for 
that to the American public by saying that banks need less regulation in order to get more capital flowing into 
the economy to drive growth. Not only does that mean that the E is likely too low (meaning that the P/E is not 
as high as it seems) but it could help improve ROE's as well which could increase the multiple of that higher E 
investors are willing to pay. Note that while ROEs could go higher, it's unlikely that they can get back to the 
peaks...
