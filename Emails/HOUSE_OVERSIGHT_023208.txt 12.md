Hi Jeffrey, 
As you will recall, we used this same exchange agent last year on the Calder 
1031. At the time, we discussed the merits of using a gallery versus a 
commercial exchange agent and my recommendation to Leon was to use a 
gallery. I felt that there were advantages to using a commercial exchange agent 
instead of a gallery on the 1031 side (e.g., less likelihood of a breach of 
confidentiality, IRS familiarity with CDEC in the event of an audit, security of 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023285 
funds), but that a commercial exchange agent gave us less comfort on the sales 
tax side. Leon did not want to use a gallery because he was concerned about 
confidentiality and he did not want to have to ask a gallery that he did not do 
much business with to act as exchange agent. 
When Leon first discussed the exchange for the Cezannes with me a few 
weeks ago, I asked him if he wanted to use the same exchange agent as last 
year, or if he wanted to use a gallery. I said that a gallery carried little to no risk 
on the sales tax side, but I reminded him that he had not wanted to use a gallery 
last year for the Calder because of confidentiality reasons. He said to use the 
same exchange agent as before, which made sense to me because he was 
extremely concerned about confidentiality with the purchase of the Cezannes. 
I will find out about sales tax audits and will let you know. The exchange agent 
has had a New York resale certificate since 2014 and has been engaged in art 
transactions like this since then, but I do not believe they have been audited. I 
will check, though, and I will also ask the Herrick lawyer if any of his clients who 
have done similar deals have been audited. 
Best, 
Heather
