Good Afternoon Mr. Dershowitz, 
I'm John Sullivan, a reporter at The Washington Post. I've been reading with great interest stories 
about allegations that former President Clinton spent time on Jeffrey Epstein's Caribbean Island. In a 
declaration you filled in federal court you state that you have reason to believe this is not true. Are 
you available to discuss this with me? Thank you for your time.
