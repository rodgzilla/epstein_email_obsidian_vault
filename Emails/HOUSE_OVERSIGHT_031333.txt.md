Russia Says IMF Chief Jailed For Discovering All US Gold is 
Gone 
A new report prepared for Prime Minister Putin by the Federal Security Service (FSB) says that former 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) Chief Dominique Strauss[[-]]Kahn was charged and jailed in the US for sex 
crimes on May 14th after his discovery that all of the gold held in the United States Bullion Depository located 
at Fort Knox was 'missing and / or unaccounted' for. 
According [[To]] this FSB secret report, Strauss[[-]]Kahn had become "increasingly concerned" earlier this month 
after the United States began "stalling" its pledged delivery [[To]] the IMF of 191.3 tons of gold agreed [[To]] under 
the Second Amendment of the Articles of Agreement signed by the Executive Board in April 1978 that were [[To]] 
be sold [[To]] fund what are called Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) as an alternative [[To]] what are called reserve 
currencies. 
This FSB report further states that upon Strauss[[-]]Kahn raising his concerns with American government officials 
close [[To]] President Obama he was 'contacted' by 'rogue elements' within the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) 
who providedhim 'firm evidence' that all of the gold reported [[To]] be held by the US 'was gone'. 
Upon Strauss[[-]]Kahn receiving the CIA evidence, this report continues, he made immediate arrangements [[To]] 
leave the US for Paris, but when contacted by agents working for France's General Directorate for [[External]] 
Security (DGSE) that American authorities were seeking his capture he fled [[To]] New York City's JFK airport 
following these agents directive not [[To]] take his cell[[-]]phone because US police could track his exact location. 
Once Strauss[[-]]Kahn was safely boarded on an Air France flight [[To]] Paris, however, this FSB report says he made 
a 'fatal mistake' by calling the hotel [[From]] a phone on the plane and asking them [[To]] forwarded the cell[[-]]phone 
he had been told [[To]] leave behind [[To]] his French residence, after which US agents were able [[To]] track and 
apprehend him. 
Within the past fortnight, this report continues, Strauss[[-]]Kahn reached out [[To]] his close friend and top Egyptian 
banker Mahmoud Abdel Salam Omar [[To]] retrieve [[From]] the US the evidence given [[To]] him by the CIA. Omar, 
however, and [[Exactly]] like Strauss[[-]]Kahn before him, was charged yesterday by the US with a sex crime against 
a luxury hotel maid, a charge the FSB labels as 'beyond belief' due [[To]] Omar being 74[[-]]years[[-]]old and a devout 
Muslim.

In an astounding move puzzling many in Moscow, Putin after reading this secret FSB report today ordered 
posted [[To]] the Kremlin's official website a defense of Strauss[[-]]Khan becoming the first world leader [[To]] state that 
the former IMF chief was a victim of a US conspiracy. Putin further stated, "It's hard for me [[To]] evaluate the 
hidden political motives but [[I]] cannot believe that it looks the way it was initially introduced. It doesn't sit right 
in my head. 
Interesting [[To]] note about all of these events is that one of the United States top Congressman, and 2012 
Presidential candidate, Ron Paul has long stated his belief that the US government has lied about its gold 
reserves held at Fort Knox. So concerned had Congressman Paul become about the US government and the 
Federal Reserve hiding the truth about American gold reserves he put forward a bill in late 2010 [[To]] force an 
audit of them, but which was subsequently defeated by Obama regime forces. 
When directly asked by reporters if he believed there was no gold in Fort Knox or the Federal Reserve, 
Congressman Paul gave the incredible reply, "[[I]] think it is a possibility." 
Also interesting [[To]] note is that barely 3 days after the arrest of Strauss[[-]]Kahn, Congressman Paul made a new 
call for the US [[To]] sell its gold reserves by stating, "Given the high price it is now, and the tremendous debt 
problem we now have, by all means, sell at the peak." 
Bizarre reports emanating [[From]] the US for years, however, suggest there is no gold [[To]] sell, and as we can read 
as posted in 2009 on the ViewZone.[[Com]] news site: 
"In October of 2009 the Chinese received a shipment of gold bars. Gold is regularly exchanged between 
countries [[To]] pay debts and [[To]] settle the so[[-]]called balance of trade. 
Most gold is exchanged and stored in vaults under the supervision of a special organization based in London, 
the London Bullion Market Association (or LBMA). When the shipment was received, the Chinese government 
asked that special tests be performed [[To]] guarantee the purity and weight of the gold bars. In this test, four 
small holes are drilled into the gold bars and the metal is then analyzed. 
Officials were shocked [[To]] learn that the bars were fake. They contained cores of tungsten with only a outer 
coating of real gold. What's more, these gold bars, containing serial numbers for tracking, originated in the US 
and had been stored in Fort Knox for years. There were reportedly between 5,600 [[To]] 5,700 bars, weighing 400 
oz. each, in the shipment!" 
[[To]] the final fate of Strauss[[-]]Kahn it is not in our knowing, but new reports coming [[From]] the United States show 
his determination not [[To]] go down without a fight as he has hired what is described as a 'crack team' of former 
CIA spies, private investigators and media advisers [[To]] defend him. 
[[To]] the practical effects on the global economy should it be proved that the US, indeed, has been lying about 
its gold reserves, Russia's Central Bank yesterday ordered the interest rate raised [[From]] 0.25 [[To]] 3.5 percent and 
Putin ordered the export ban on wheat and grain crops lifted by July 1st in a move designed [[To]] fill the 
Motherlands coffers with money that normally would have flowed [[To]] the US. 
The American peoples ability [[To]] know the truth of these things, and [[As Always]], has been shouted out by their 
propaganda media organs leaving them in danger of not being prepared for the horrific economic collapse of 
their nation now believed will much sooner than later.
