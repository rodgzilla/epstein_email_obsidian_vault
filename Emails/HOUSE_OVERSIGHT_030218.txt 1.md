Dear Richard, 
For the first time in my life, I am facing the real prospect of dismissal from the project. 
This is due mainly to misunderstanding. 
Mr. Epstein came today and told me very bluntly that he is annoyed with me not doing the job. I prepared one column for him 
and the several feet of decorative molding, but this was a miss. He told me it looks like it was done yesterday. 
This is the very first time that I work like this. I did several projects for French customers in Greenwich, Conn., but always I 
produced the sample and than work 
according to the samples. The paneling I work on were early 19 c. so even the oak looked different. Even at the White House, 
when I was restoring Blue Room, which you can look at it on my Website, www.brandonthompsonrestoration.com I produced 
design, made samples and did the project. President Clinton told me this is the most beautiful Room, he was clearly 
impressed. 
This time I know exactly what Mr. Epstein wants. However it might be too late. He will come tomorrow to check. 
Today I did a lot of prep work for tomorrow. I will go tonight to work on some of the columns but the night light is deceiving 
and I may miss the last chance he gave me. 
So far I was rated the best finisher, until now I guess. 
Warm regards 
Brandon

Dear Richard, 
the samples are ready for approval. I finished one column about 95%, as I want to put some accents on it but after I discuss it 
with Mr. Epstein. I also finished upper section above the blackboard. I also finished some other columns, not completely, 
because I need the approval. My feeling is that someone was already working in the Library, as I can see a lot of waxing done. 
I finished one column so it will correspond with the rest of the decor. You can not remove the whitish color completely. 
There are some "bald" columns, which in my opinion do not sort of belong to the Library any more as they are completely 
brown. Everything has to have at least an shadow of what is around. The top carving, moldings columns and other elements 
in the Library, have to "bond" together. The upper small carvings, have to be finished individually, as a play between the 
whitish color and natural brown color of oak wood. I sort of model the shapes of the crabs, snails and other creatures and 
they come alive. I think I did good work but Mr. Epstein needs to approve it so I can go ahead and finish the project. 
Kindly, 
Brandon

Dear Richard, 
I prepared some samples for Mr. Epstein for today. I did not waist time as there is a lot of work in the Library. However, I 
need his approval to continue. Tonight I will go back and start installation of the doors and panels.

Dear Richard, 
I am not sure whether the photos depict the column right. I looked at it and does not do the justice to what you have on 
the column. I hope you can see the details like even changing the white areas into rubbed ones and emphasising crabs. 
Making the rope "wet" looking, contrasting the rubbed areas with white, and looking at the entire column as a whole. 
All the columns are looking different, as somebody would work previously on them, and some of them are over-rubbed, 
some of them are not rubbed at all. The upper part also, I prepared a sample, so Mr. Epstein can see the difference.
