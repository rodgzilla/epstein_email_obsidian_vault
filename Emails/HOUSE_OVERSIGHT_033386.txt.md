Jeffrey-
! need to start off by stating that it is not my intent to go around Shawn Lancaster on this — Shawn is a friend. 
This being said, I have received e-mails from both you and Larry this weekend. 
I called Larry and he said I should send you an e-mail. 
I called a close friend of mine inquiring about the GV market and aircraft that are "not published". As of today, 
there are eight (8) of these aircraft that are not yet on the market. 
Let me know if you would like to speak with him and by what means (you call him, he call you, call 
Larry ....whatever). 
By the way, his company sold Trumps 727 and got Trump a very attractive number for an aircraft that was on 
it's way to a museum. 
Hope all is well. 
Sincerely, 
Eric Roth 
President
