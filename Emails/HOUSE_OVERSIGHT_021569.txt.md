Prostitution Ring Leader Sentenced To 21 Months 
November 11,2001 I Staff report 
A man extradited from Germany has been sentenced to 21 months in prison 
and fined $6,000 for recruiting Czech women to a prostitution ring with 
promises of modeling work. 
Ronald Eppinger had faced up to 10 years after pleading guilty this month to 
charges of alien smuggling for prostitution, interstate travel for prostitution and 
money laundering. 
Eppinger worked with two Czech women to get tourist visas for the future 
prostitutes and kept nearly half of their earnings from operations in Miami, New 
York, Texas and the Bahamas, prosecutors said. Women were brought to the United States illegally from 1997 to 1999.

As part of his plea, Eppinger forfeited a boat and limousine used to promote the call-girl service. 
Eppinger learned he was under investigation in June 1999 and moved from the United States to the Czech capital of Prague. 
He was arrested in Germany last December while traveling from the Czech Republic to Spain and was sent to the United 
States in May.

U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra is set to decide in the coming 
days whether the rights of two alleged victims of Palm Beach sex 
offender Jeffrey Epstein were violated when the U.S. Attorney's 
Office failed to confer with them before signing a non-prosecution 
agreement in September 2007. 
Attorneys Brad Edwards and Paul Cassell, representing Jane Doe 
No. 1 and Jane Doe No. 2, argued Friday in federal court in West 
Palm Beach that the government's action violated the girls' rights 
under the federal Crime Victims' Rights Act. 
Edwards and Cassell want the agreement nullified and want Marra to 
unseal un-redacted plea deal correspondence between the U.S. 
Attorney's Office and Epstein's defense team. If he agrees, that 
action could spur a federal case that might expose Epstein to a 
longer incarceration if convicted. 
After Palm Beach police received a complaint about Epstein in spring 
2005, more than 30 young women participated in civil lawsuits that 
alleged he lured them to his home for sexually charged rubdowns 
and/or sex in exchange for cash when they were minors. Some 
cases were dismissed, and others were settled.

Epstein, now 58, pleaded not guilty in August 2006 in state court. 
Eventually he agreed to a state plea deal and served 13 months of 
an 18-month sentence for soliciting a minor for prostitution and 
soliciting prostitution — but only after his attorneys successfully 
argued for the federal non-prosecution pact. 
The U.S. attorneys sent letters to Jane Doe No. 1 and No. 2 twice in 
2008 describing their case as being under federal investigation — 
even though a non-prosecution agreement had been created the 
previous year and had been kept secret from the young women, 
according to Edwards. Edwards said the latter action "eviscerated the 
rights" of the two women to bring Epstein to justice. 
Assistant U.S. Attorney Dexter Lee told Marra that the Crime Victims' 
Rights Act dictates that victim notification is triggered only after an 
indictment. 
Cassell disagreed. "It wasn't designed to be so narrowly 
circumscribed," the Fort Lauderdale lawyer said. 
Lee said requiring federal attorneys to confer with alleged victims 
before they can determine whether an indictment is warranted would 
impinge on prosecutorial discretion. "The government believes these 
rights would attach only after a formal indictment," Lee said. 
Marra questioned that assertion. "I think we wouldn't be here if your 
office had conferred with the victims, heard them out," and explained 
why prosecution wasn't pursued, the judge said. 
Lee countered that alleged victims have no right to confer with the 
government when the government is not "in the case." 
The judge reserved ruling on the plaintiffs' motion to unseal the 
federal attorneys' plea deal correspondence with Epstein's legal 
team. 
He gave famed criminal defense attorney Roy Black two weeks to 
submit materials explaining why the letters should not be turned over 
to the two young women's lawyers. The U.S. Attorney's Office will 
then have two weeks to respond, then the plaintiffs' team will have a 
week to respond. Black will then have a week to deliver his final reply 
to the judge. 
Black had argued that the correspondence was protected by attorney 
-client privilege. "Any statements made in regard to plea bargaining 
are immunized" whether related to statements of culpability or not, 
Black said. "This is classic work product we sent to the government."
