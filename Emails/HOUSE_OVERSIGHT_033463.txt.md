[[Jeffrey]]-
[[Wrote]]: 
[[I]] need [[To]] start off by stating that it is not my intent [[To]] go around Shawn Lancaster on this — Shawn is a friend. 
This being said, [[I]] have received e[[-]]mails [[From]] both you and [[Larry]] this weekend. 
[[I]] called [[Larry]] and he said [[I]] should send you an e[[-]]mail. 
[[I]] called a close friend of mine inquiring about the GV market and aircraft that are "not published". As of today, there are 
eight (8) of these aircraft that are not yet on the market. 
Let me know if you would like [[To]] speak with him and by what means (you call him, he call you, call [[Larry]]?....whatever). 
By the way, his company sold Trumps 727 and got Trump a very attractive number for an aircraft that was on it's way [[To]] 
a museum. 
Hope all is well. 
Sinc erely,
