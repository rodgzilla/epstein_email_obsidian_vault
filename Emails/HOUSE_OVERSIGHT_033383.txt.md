I have heard some things about it. 
B of A has note on house and the land across the street now subdivided into lots (a few acres each) called Vineyard 
Estates. 
Farm Credit Bank has note on winery and equipment. 
Trump has tried to make a deal with the lenders but didnt. He may bid. 
I'll find out current status.
