Hi.. so, here is the event [[I]] am still invited [[To]] give in Germany. It is Oct 19th. [[I]] was previously invited [[To]] give a 
major lecture in Heidelberg Oct 14 but they had [[To]] cancel it after the university determination re australia was 
publicized by the bitch. That air ticket, which they had paid fo, was about 5250 euros. There is a $900 
cancellation fee, and they have agreed [[To]] let me keep the ticket if [[I]] pay them 4500 euros. [[I]] offered that [[To]] the 
other place but they only have $5K USD total, which includes the $4K fee they originally offered me. [[I]] am 
going [[To]] check other tickets now, but wanted [[To]] know if you might be flying [[To]] europe around then and could 
take a hitchhiker. :)
