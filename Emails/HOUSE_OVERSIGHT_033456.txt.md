Let me know when you are coming back to Palm Beach so I can take you for golf at Trump. Also coordinate with 
Andy re: his trip here from California. 
Jeffrey mentioned to me you are looking to pick up an interest in a Hawker 800 XP. I recently exchanged my fractional 
interest for a jet pass card but I may know some other people who might want to sell their interests at a bargain 
price. Also, Jeffrey's and my friend, Benny Shabtai is looking to partner with someone to pick up a plane in today's 
depressed market, but he is looking for someone to pick up a 50% interest. 
Look forward to hearing from you.
