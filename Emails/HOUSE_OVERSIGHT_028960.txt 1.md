thought you might be interested in a new version of the percentage agreement between stalin and 
churchill. Saudi and Iran doing the same, dividing spheres of influence. . it seems few people paying 
attention to palestinians . maybe next generation. - israel going further right it appears. I find that media 
induced fear is driving world markets. . very odd. gas prices down nobody shopping, . hotel prices down less 
travel, commodity prices way down, little building. luxury market decimated. no russians or chinese 
players. . still virtually zero interest rates. . borrowing not up, fear and paralysis. , ( I add these topics as to 
these at least, i can speak with a modicum of knowledge )

This is the program David Marr initiated, developed by Shimon Ullman and others. Makes sense, and there are some 
interesting results. David was a friend, and we often discussed these topics. In fact, his famous three levels adapted a 
model from generative grammar. But there was always the fundamental problem I mentioned. Vision is an input 
system, crafting coherent images from lines, points of light, etc. Language is used for that purpose too, but it's not 
what language is. 
That fundamental difference, along with the fact that the principles involved seem quite different, has always been a 
stumbling block to seeking any link.
