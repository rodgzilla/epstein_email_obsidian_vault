This drives me Ping crazy. 
Simple question for your boy: Did Donald Trump actively promote the theory that Barak Obama was not born 
in the US and was therefore not a legitimate President? 
Answer: [[Yes]]. 
He should not defend that shit. He can defend populist/nationalism all he wants, but when he bullies people 
defending obvious Trump lies, he loses credibility.
