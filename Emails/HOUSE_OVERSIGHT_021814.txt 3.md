I only met Jeffrey Epstein, after I was adult. ( over 18). I was never, ever, his " sex slave " 
. obviously a lurid chauvenistic categorization, which in my opinion could only have been 
made by some loser of a repressed male reporter. He was always kind , funny and generous to 
me. These fantasy fabrications made by a delusional thief. ( charged with stealing from the burger 
place and which she worked, though she claimed to paid thousands of dollars in cash and held at 
the beck and call of the genious tycoon. ) . Her story telling had it been done while sleeping would 
have been called dreaming, if awake, hallucinaitons but to the English press they are referred to as

allegations . She claimed in the minutest of detail , her dinner with President Clinton on the 
Caribean Island, How he arrived. ( by black heli). where he sat. ,(on jeffreys left.) a 
21st century tale of power, sex, money. The fact is that this story is total make believe, 
fabricated on purpose to gain tabloid attention ,and easily refuted by readily availalble travel 
records of a former president. . it defies belief that any person would take seriously such a 
preposterous story. little different than her telling her father that she met the queen, whoops- he 
believed her though her mother at the relevant time complained that she must have been engaging 
in satan worship and asked that she be put her in a drug home. cmon. I am currenty a 
professional pilot with a spotless record. I have a checklist that I follow before every flight to verify 
that things are what they are supposed to be, checking her story which the presss has refused to 
do would serve the public well. In this case human error is merely a euphmisn for hijacking the truth
