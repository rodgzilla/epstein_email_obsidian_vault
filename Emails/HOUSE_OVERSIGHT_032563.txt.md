[[Jeffrey]], 
Huffington Post is almost done with their article. They need couple answers [[To]] use them for your quotes. Please 
see below. 
Questions for you: 
[[1]]. As a result of Trump's budget cuts, more scientists are turning [[To]] private donors for funds. How have you 
helped these scientists thrive during this time in particular? 
2. Why do you think it's important [[To]] have funded the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics and how will this 
program help us in the future? 
Questions for a scientist (can [[I]] ask Martin [[To]] answer and quote him)? 
[[1]]. How has Jeffery [[Epstein]]'s donations helped you advance your research? 
Let me know if you have any questions or comments. Would appreciate speedy response. 
Thank you!
