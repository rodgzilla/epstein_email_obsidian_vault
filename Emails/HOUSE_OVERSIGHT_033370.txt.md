I spoke to my FAA in Orlando, it will take the buyer 6 months to obtain a FAR125 certificate if we do not include ours, 
Darren and Rich are working on possibility of including JEGE, INC with sale of Boeing, this will be valuable to buyer and 
prove to be beneficial monetarily to you if we can include the company name in the sale. FAA informs me its taken 
under into consideration on a case by case basis if they will approve another buyer to operate my FAR125 certificate. My 
FAA inspector did mention that Trump did the same deal when he purchased his B757, it included the manuals and 
company.
