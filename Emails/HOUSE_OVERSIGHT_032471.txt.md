So...[[I]]'m doing this Trump book for a pile of money and with so far quite a bit of cooperation [[From]] them (DT 
called me the other day and spent 45 minutes on the phone ranting and raving about the media--alarming). [[I]] 
wonder if you could introduce me [[To]] [[Tom]] Barrack--just [[To]] say [[I]]'m a journalist who you know and trust, and that 
[[I]]'ll follow up with a description of the project that [[I]]'m doing. Also, [[I]]'d love a reintroduction [[To]] [[Kathy]] [[Ruemmler]]. 
[[I]] need some off[[-]]the[[-]]record perspective on White House procedures. 
Are you in NYC soon?
