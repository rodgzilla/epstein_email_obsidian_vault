In taking his case to Washington, Mr. Aliyev has variously sought safe passage to the United States, help in 
recovering $2 billion that relatives claimed they lost from seized businesses, or at least the satisfaction of 
embarrassing Mr. Nazarbayev. For his part, the Kazakh leader wants to make sure that the Americans stay out 
of the dispute, and not allow it to affect their alliance with his government. 
The Obama administration has done just that. Through comments in secret diplomatic cables, the former 
ambassador to Kazakhstan made clear his wariness of being drawn in. 
"Both sides — the government and Aliyev — seek to manipulate us to their own advantage," Richard E. 
Hoagland, who ended his term as United States ambassador early this year, wrote in February 2009 in one of 
more than a dozen State Department cables obtained by the antisecrecy group WikiLeaks that mentioned the 
dispute. [*] 
Mr. Nazarbayev, 70, [*]a former steel worker and Soviet-era Communist Party leader, has been in power for 
two decades, presiding over Central Asia's most vibrant economy. Human rights activists, however, have 
long accused him of persecuting dissidents and political opponents. 
Mr. Aliyev, 48, [*]has served as chief of the tax police, deputy foreign affairs minister and head of the 
Kazakh equivalent of the K.G.B. But critics say he used his clout to secretly take over private companies for 
financial gain, often by threatening violence. 
Now hiding somewhere in Europe, he has been convicted back home on what he claims are trumped-up 
criminal charges, including a coup attempt. His wife divorced him in June 2007, and the Kazakh government 
has taken businesses owned by him and members of his extended family. [*] 
No longer powerful at home, Mr. Aliyev turned to Washington, knowing that his former father-in-law cared 
greatly about his reputation there. 
Early in 2008 he hired RJI Government Strategies, a small Washington lobbying group whos 
e consultants 
included Tanya Rahall, sister of Representative Nick J. Rahall II, a West Virginia Democrat; and a friend of 
Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California. Both congressmen were booked on a trip to Kazakhstan 
to discuss energy policy with Mr. Nazarbayev. 
Before their departure, members of___________________________to urge him to express strong concerns about the 
harm done to a relative of Mr. Aliyev named Devincci Hourani, whose oil-company assets in Kazakhstan 
were seized, according to a letter to Mr. Issa from RJI. 
Mr. Issa, who had developed a rapport with the Kazakh president on an earlier visit, nonetheless agreed to 
take up the plight of Mr. Hourani. Though he stepped into the fight, he still maintained a close connection to 
the president, nominating him that summer for the Nobel Prize, a move that drew ridicule from human rights 
activists. [that's right, of Vista, CA] [*] 
Ms. Rahall worked on behalf of Mr. Aliyev and later for Mr. Hourani through 2010, contacting the offices of 
at least two dozen members of Congress. They included Representative Howard L. Berman, Democrat of 
California, then chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, whose office said he discussed the dispute 
with the State Department. 
Ms. Rahall also pursued a second strategy. "The alternative is to embarrass the existing regime," she wrote in 
a July 2008 e-mail to her boss. 
She pressed House members to criticize the Kazakh government's human rights record. At her request, at 
least five statements were published in the Congressional Record, one citing Mr. Aliyev as a victim of his 
government. Separately, Mr. Aliyev offered to provide the Justice Department with documents that he 
claimed could prove that his former father-in-law accepted bribes from a businessman representing American 
oil companies that were seeking drilling rights in Kazakhstan
