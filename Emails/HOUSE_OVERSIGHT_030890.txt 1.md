re vanity fair, paul seems imbalanced„ so many intricate computing details but fuzzy on reality. He seems like 
a wife that has been divorced for a younger girl . re woody allen„ my fault„ Charlie rose was also there. he 
has a big mouth.-- wasn't there a science person or someone that worked with consuelo that you thought 
intersting?

[[I]] will email Steve and Lawerence. 
[[I]] am curious what you think about Vanity fair piece? 
How the daily beast knows about that dinner with woody allen and the crew? 
Who would know that? Some of your employees?
