Read an interesting article on why Comey screwed Clinton. Came from Israeli press. 
1. Comey as DA is hunting down Marc Rich to indict him. 
2. Ehud calls Clinton and says please pardon Marc Rich he has done work for Mossad that has been valuable. 
3. Clinton pardons Rich and Comey has been pissed ever since. 
4. Comey got his opening to get even. 
No idea if this is accurate story.
