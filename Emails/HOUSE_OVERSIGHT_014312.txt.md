Our Financials Conference was this week and client attendance was up by 66% from last year. Yes, banks/financials 
might pull back at some point after this run-up but we would be buyers on any pullbacks and we continue to see further 
upside from multiple expansion and earnings growth. Our analyst raised her price targets by —11% across the board. The 
long term rotation from bonds and div stocks into sectors like financials is only beginning. 
Vol is higher on the week; what prices well now: 
Buy the XLF March 2017 $22 call with $26 Knock-Out (continuous) for $0.87, with a full premium 
rebate if knock-out occurs. 
This prices attractively given flat call skew and if XLF breaches $26 and this knocks out, at least you get your 
premium back. 
Please find our Financials report attached. 
Future of Financials conference hosted 90 public and private companies at our Future of Financials conference. We are 
raising our price objectives across most of our names. Three primary reasons why we think there is upside remaining 
after the recent rally: 1) an improved outlook on both activity levels and interest rates, driving revenue upside; 2) 
potentially lower regulatory burden, particularly as new supervisory leadership can come with the new administration; 
and 3) relatively lighter positioning in US financials vs. other sectors. (Erika Najarian)
