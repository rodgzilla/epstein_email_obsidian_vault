Hi, 
Would be great if Lisa could visit us. She sounds like the right person [[To]] help us get organized. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029530 
Maldives just got elected Vice President of International Renewable Energy Agency. We are also Vice Chair 
of the UN Human Rights Council. Not too bad considering we had so much bad coverage this year 
internationally. 
Best regards, 
Waheed

Hi, 
The campaign team is starting [[To]] come together. We are continuing discussions with Jim and tomorrow we 
will meet him face [[To]] face on skype. We will brief him on the situation here so that he will be able [[To]] advice 
us more effectively. Already he has [[Sent]] some very useful suggestions and we are working on them. 
Getting the right people [[To]] head various aspects on the campaign is difficult here but we should be able [[To]] 
pull the team together shortly. 
We will need some more help [[From]] Ian and Rory because we are still weak on international 
communication. Some old negative stuff keeps coming up in the Guardian newspaper in England. But most 
of the international media is not paying much attention [[To]] Maldives right now. 
[[I]] have asked Rory [[To]] help find a full time communications guy [[To]] stay here for about a year [[To]] work with 
me. He doesn't have [[To]] be an expert, just a good graduate student would do. Some really positive stuff is 
also happening now and we need the world [[To]] know about them. 
World Energy Forum and CGI guys are here. [[I]] am meeting Clinton people in a few minutes. 
[[I]] have some funding now but will ask all friends [[To]] help raise more later when things start happening in full 
swing. Election is now scheduled [[To]] early September. 
Hope all is well and look forward [[To]] seeing you here in the not too distant future. 
Warm regards, 
Waheed
