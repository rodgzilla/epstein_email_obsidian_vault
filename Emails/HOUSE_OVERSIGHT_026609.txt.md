Dear Mr Epstein, 
> 
Further to emails ofJanuary 21, I crossed an image of a rare 17th Century Marble Bust of Roman Emperor Vitellius 
you purchased from me during the second half of the 90's. 
I recalled upon many occasions you visiting Bennison, Pimlico Road and being extremely respectful and courteous, 
as Miss Maxwell was on each occasion. 
From recent media reports about you and our Prince Andrew, I do not believe you, Miss Maxwell and Prince Andrew 
would undermine your conduct the way reports are suggesting. 
I feel for you all and hope this episode clears so you can concentrate on your professional activities that do positive 
things for our countries. 
You may have heard a report an interesting report conducted by a genius Lawyer Michael Shrimpton - Michael 
Shrimpton youtube - Exposes Ted Heath (and others) 
The report is shocking and is not a hair-line what you are wrongly accused of (based upon our many meetings). 
Further David Dicke reports on the USA former President George W. Bush Senior which again is shocking, 
unbelievable, unacceptable... 
Mr Michael Shrimpton & Mr David Dicke are worth watching if you haven't yet crossed their researching of public 
figures that have (literally by reports) got away with murder. 
Please find attached an image of Vitellius, pair of 19th Century Medici Lions (that are perfect for one of your estates), 
emperor Vespasian and a pair of Piranesi Engravings for your consideration. 
Do not hesitate to contact me should you require more details. 
Warm regards, 
Yours sincerely, 
Mark Green. 
Cel. 
BEST WISHES TO THE THREE OF YOU!!!
