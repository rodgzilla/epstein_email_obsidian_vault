Tonja--
The National ENQUIRER is preparing [[To]] publish a story that Bill Clinton used a private "orgy" jet [[To]] travel [[To]] 
Brunei for an extraordinary dinner with a royal accused of duping American women into "white slavery." 
The ENQUIRER will report that Bill was accompanied by the 727's owner, billionaire pedophile [[Jeffrey]] [[Epstein]], 
when he landed in the tiny South[[-]]East Asian country on May 25, 2002. His entourage also included two 
women who allegedly worked as "madams" for [[Epstein]], luring teenaged [[Girls]] into sex trysts with the tycoon 
and his powerful and famous friends. 
According [[To]] The ENQUIRER's investigation, Bill spent the day playing golf at a seven[[-]]star hotel -- and then was 
invited [[To]] dine with Brunei's sultan, Hassanal Bolkiah .....who was charged with holding a deeply[[-]]religious 
Christian beauty queen as a "human chattel." Far [[From]] being embarrassed by the ruler's tawdry 
reputation, moreover, records for Bill's nonprofit foundation reveal that Brunei made a donation towards his 
Clinton Presidential Library that year of between $[[1]]. million and $5 million. 
Please kindly attempt [[To]] provide any comment by 4 pm ET tomorrow, Friday January 30th [[To]] Lachlan 
Cartwright, Executive Editor, at [Office] or
