[[Steve Bannon]] almost appeared in [[Michael]] 
Moore's 'Fahrenheit 11/9' 
[[Steve Bannon]] was invited [[To]] be in [[Michael]] Moore's latest documentary, "Fahrenheit 11/9," 
and while the former White House strategist declined [[To]] go on camera, he did meet with 
Moore for two hours, the filmmaker revealed after the film's NYC premiere. 
After a Lincoln Center screening, Moore, at a Tavern on the Green party, revealed Bannon 
was almost in the film. "We wanted [[Steve Bannon]] [[To]] answer that first question in the film: 
'How the f—k did this happen?' " the liberal gadfly told guests. 
"It took a long time. We finally got him [[To]] come over, no cameras ... He said he wanted [[To]] 
talk [[To]] me first. And we talked [[To]] him for two hours." 
Ultimately, Bannon decided not [[To]] go on camera, but the conversation had a seismic impact 
on the finished film anyway. 
"He said something very profound [[To]] us, and it changed us and it changed the course of the 
film," Moore said of Bannon. "[[I]] asked him, 'How did you pull this [Trump's election] 
off?' And he said, 'It's a very easy answer. Our side, we go for the head wound. Your side, 
you have pillow fights.'" 
Moore continued, "That so f—ked us up [[To]] hear him say that ... watching him smirk as he 
said it. As soon as he left, we decided [[To]] watch the film... and put the pillow fight filter." 
One example Moore gave of a change [[To]] his film post[[-]]Bannon was a line about news 
networks being run by men, [[From]] "most" [[To]] "all." 
"It's amazing how we talk as liberals. We always want [[To]] be nice and maybe be fair," Moore 
explained. 
The film also jabs at the media, highlighting major newsmen who have turned out [[To]] be 
predators, including Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose.

A spy told us, "Everyone in the theater hissed when Les Moonves' face came up on[[-]]screen." 
Moore also held a Q&A after the screening. 
The movie's already premiered in Moore's hometown of Flint, Mich., and played the 
Toronto International Film Festival.
