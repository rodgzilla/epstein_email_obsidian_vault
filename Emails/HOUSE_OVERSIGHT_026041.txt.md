Good. Sorting out Tulum at the moment. Over 40 people wanted to come. The Cenote project didn't get 
funded yet so we are sorting out accommodations. David Sauvage who you met is coming 
(https://docs.google.com/document/d/lzebY0wGi vn1WpUnkTR1T7yPsl-iQIfA9GidDUgOzeU/edit). Joon 
Yun as well (who I'd like to introduce you to - http://www.drjoonyun.com/). The gathering will help plan 
activities in 2017 which I will summarise for you in Jan. 
On Monday, I head to Pragelato with the wife and kids for 10 days of skiing and sight-seeing. Head to Tulum 
on the 1st. I will be at DLD and Davos afterward. I still have a Vive that I got for you that I'd like to set up and 
walk you and your people through. 
Is your schedule for the holidays sorted? 
Happy Holidays!!
