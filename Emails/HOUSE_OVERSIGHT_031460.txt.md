They're Not Really Out [[To]] Get You 
By EDWARD JAY [[Epstein]] 
Dec. 18, 2015, Wall Street Journal 
[[1]] 
Conspiracy, a word derived [[From]] the Latin "[[To]] breathe together," has been a salient part of the darker 
side of recorded history ever since some 60 conspirators in the Roman senate, including Brutus and 
Cassius, plotted together [[To]] assassinate Julius Caesar in 44 B.C. Nowadays the "C" word does not always 
sit well with journalists, who commonly employ it in conjunction with "theory" [[To]] describe paranoid 
distortions of reality. 
Even so, a criminal conspiracy is not a rare phenomenon. Not only was a foreign conspiracy responsible 
for the monstrous 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center (as well as the previous attempt [[To]] blow it up in 
1993) but, according [[To]] the Center on Law and Security at Fordham University, over 90% of routine federal 
indictments for terrorist attacks since 9/11 contain at least one conspiracy charge. The government's 
pursuit of conspiracies is by no means limited [[To]] terrorism. Conspiracy charges are the rule rather than 
the exception in cases brought against businessmen accused of fixing prices, evading environmental 
regulations, using insider information or laundering money. 
But there are also pseudo[[-]]conspiracies that exist only in a delusionary or misinformed mind. And some of 
them achieve a huge following. In Pakistan, according [[To]] public opinion polls, a majority of the 
population believes that the 9/11 attack was staged by President George [[W]]. Bush [[To]] launch a war on Islam. 
The claim that the 1969 moon landing was faked is still around. Just two days ago a crew [[From]] a Russian 
TV channel rushed [[To]] my apartment [[To]] interview me about a viral post on YouTube in which the deceased 
director Stanley Kubrick supposedly made a deathbed confession [[To]] having filmed the landing in a 
Hollywood studio—even though everything about the post, including a fake Kubrick, was untrue. 
Why people believe in pseudo[[-]]conspiracies is the focus of Rob Brotherton's fascinating book "Suspicious 
Minds." Mr. Brotherton, an academic psychologist, advances the thesis that the belief in pseudo-
conspiracies proceeds [[From]] the "quirks and foibles" in the way that the human brain, or at least some 
human brains, process evidence. He lucidly reviews studies showing common defects in the brain's wiring, 
such as the bias that selects evidence [[To]] confirm rather than undermine a pre[[-]]adopted thesis. "We seek 
what we expect [[To]] find," as Mr. Brotherton puts it. Relatedly, "biased assimilation" causes us [[To]] 
"interpret ambiguous events in light of what we already believe." 
Discussing Richard Hofstadter's 1964 essay "The Paranoid Style in American Politics," Mr. Brotherton 
accepts Hofstadter's characterization of proponents of politically motivated conspiracy theories as 
"paranoid" and suffering [[From]] "a psychic phenomenon" that prevents them [[From]] seeing the absurdity of 
their position. But he disagrees with Hofstadter that this condition affects only a small number of 
people on the fringes of society. For Mr. Brotherton, "conspiracy theories thrive in the mainstream." 
Until the controversy over the validity of Warren Commission's 1966 report on the Kennedy assassination, 
the phrase "conspiracy theory" had a more neutral meaning, suggesting a plausible yet unproven claim 
about multiple actors in a single event. Only in the aftermath of the Warren Commission did it become a 
derogatory term used [[To]] suggest theories that subvert conventional wisdom. [[To]] those who doubted the 
commission's finding that a single gunman killed Kennedy, Earl Warren became, Mr. Brotherton's says, the 
"figurehead in a vast cover[[-]]up." 
It is not easy [[To]] find an objective criterion that distinguishes the inquiry into a real conspiracy [[From]] 
one that chases a pseudo[[-]]conspiracy. Both types rely are the eyewitnesses, documents and forensic 
evidence. The best that Mr. Brotherton can offer on this score is [[To]] cite Stewart Potter's famous comment 
on pornography: "[[I]] know it when [[I]] see it." In the context of suspicious minds, though, one person might 
see a plausible case for a conspiracy and another only outlandish connections. The distinction is in the 
mind of the beholder. 
Mr. Brotherton offers a sample list of conspiracy theories, including ones alleging that Abraham Lincoln 
was assassinated on the orders of his vice president; that the moon landing was faked; that Area 51 in 
New Mexico is home [[To]] extra[[-]]terrestrial technology under government auspices; that President Obama is "a 
communist Muslim [[From]] Kenya." Such theories are meant [[To]] show that suspicious minds leap [[To]] absurd 
conclusions. These are chosen because there is no evidence [[To]] support them. 
The picture changes, however, if we consider, for example, the theory claiming that Lincoln's assassin, 
John Wilkes Booth was part of a larger conspiracy backed by the Confederacy. On April 14, 1865, at about 
the same time that Booth shot Lincoln, one of his associates stabbed Secretary of State William Seward 
and another stalked Vice President Andrew Johnson with a loaded gun. The military commission appointed by 
President Johnson, after hearing 371 witnesses testify and after examining Confederate bank transfers and 
cipher communications, concluded that the three attacks were part of a conspiracy sponsored by the 
Confederacy and convicted eight of Booth's associates, four of whom were hanged. Here we have a 
conspiracy theory proceeding not [[From]] crackpots but [[From]] a government commission backed by the new 
president and most members of Lincoln's cabinet.

Clearly the defects in the brain's wiring that lead [[To]] crazy theories may lead [[To]] the confirmation of 
theories that are adopted by rational people. Indeed, the confirmation bias can work in contradictory 
ways: confirming not only conspiracy theories but the impulse [[To]] reject them in favor of conventional 
wisdom. Can this defect be corrected? Here [[I]] am reminded of a woody Allen's absolutely brilliant 1996 
comedy "Everyone says [[1]] Love You," in which the once[[-]]liberal son of a New York liberal family starts 
spouting conservative theories until a doctor solves the problem by restoring the proper flow of oxygen 
[[To]] his brain. The movie has a happy ending when the son goes back [[To]] spouting his family's liberal 
theories. While Mr. Brotherton offers no such remedy [[To]] our brain's defects, he does offer a thought-
provoking analysis and an appealing guide [[To]] thinking about conspiracies, real and imagined. 
—Mr. [[Epstein]] most recent book is "The Annals of unsolved crimes." He is currently writing a book about 
Edward Snowden.
