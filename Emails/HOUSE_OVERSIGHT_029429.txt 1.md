Dear colleagues, 
We are writing [[To]] alert you [[To]] an issue that threatens all of MIT's federally funded research activities but that is often underappreciated. 
We're referring [[To]] the Trump Administration's proposal [[To]] put a 10 percent cap on indirect cost reimbursements [[To]] universities by the 
National Institutes of Health — an idea that is already beginning [[To]] be talked about for other federal agencies as well. 
An article explaining indirect costs and why they are important [[To]] MIT can be found in the most recent Faculty 
Newsletter: http://web.mit.edu/fnl/volume/295/zuber.html. 
The Administration's proposed cuts [[To]] federal R&D agency budgets have rightly been met with consternation on campus. The indirect 
cost cap proposal is actually an even graver danger because it is easier for the government [[To]] institute, and it would do far[[-]]reaching 
damage that is harder [[To]] reverse. We need faculty and research staff [[To]] understand the devastating effects that capping indirect cost 
would cause [[To]] MIT and other research institutions. 
The indirect cost cap is easier [[To]] implement than a cut [[To]] the budget because the Administration can act unilaterally without 
Congressional approval. The proposed agency budget cuts are already running into strong headwinds on both sides of the aisle in 
Congress, and they cannot move forward without 60 votes in the U.S. Senate. The indirect cost cap, by contrast, does not attract the 
same level of attention because it is not well understood, and the Administration can simply impose a cap — at a single agency, or at all 
of them (since indirect cost reimbursement is fairly uniform across the government now). 
What would a 10 percent cap mean for MIT? A 10 percent cap on all federal agencies would cost MIT around $100 million a year. [[To]] 
put that in context, the financial crisis of 2008, where we saw a significant decline in endowment, required us [[To]] reduce spending by this 
same order of magnitude. Fortunately, the recovery of the endowment was relatively quick, and we were able [[To]] recoup some of that 
loss. In this case, the 10 percent cap is unlikely [[To]] be altered in the foreseeable future. Since this is a recurring cost, attempting [[To]]

recover this in the future through endowment payout would require on the order of an additional $26 in endowment. These indirect cost 
funds partially reimburse MIT for upkeep of research buildings and equipment, and literally keeping the lights and heating and cooling 
systems on. A portion of the money also pays administrative costs required [[To]] implement federal regulations and [[To]] provide staff who 
help apply for and monitor federal grants. 
A cap on indirect costs would directly affect research and researchers. If MIT failed [[To]] receive the federal funds needed [[To]] operate 
research infrastructure, we would need [[To]] limit the number of federal grants that the Institute accepts. It would be necessary [[To]] 
introduce a process analogous [[To]] under[[-]]recovery of foundation proposals [[To]] identify the indirect costs [[To]] support each federal grant. 
While we would seek other ways [[To]] raise revenues, we would also need [[To]] cut other expenditures (e.g., through layoffs, salary freezes, 
etc.), reduce the use of research facilities [[To]] cut operating costs, and/or [[To]] allow facilities [[To]] deteriorate. All of our peer institutions are 
considering similar steps. In short, a cut [[To]] indirect costs is a cut [[To]] research funding. And it's a cut that's more difficult [[To]] handle than a 
decision by a federal agency not [[To]] fund a particular project in a given year. 
The percentage of federal research funding that goes [[To]] indirect costs has remained relatively steady for decades, and there has been 
a federal cap on administrative costs since the 1990s. The Administration may hope that a proposed cap on indirect costs is seen as 
mitigating the impact of their proposed 22% reduction of the NIH budget. Although it may obscure this impact, in reality it will worsen 
it. The Administration is claiming that a cut [[To]] indirect costs will not cut research, but in truth without indirect cost recovery, academic 
institutions, including MIT, will not be able [[To]] afford [[To]] support current levels of federal grants. 
The MIT administration is working on this matter with the urgency that it deserves. Let us be clear that no one on campus should be 
blasé or unconcerned about the proposal [[To]] cap indirect costs. Capping these costs will negatively impact every researcher at MIT. 
Please let us know if you have any questions or comments. We will keep you informed as this situation evolves. 
Sincerely, 
Martin A. Schmidt
