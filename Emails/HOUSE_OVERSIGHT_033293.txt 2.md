Mr. Weinberg 
[[I]] was referred [[To]] you by [[Alan]] Dershowitz, who told me you're [[Jeffrey]] [[Epstein]]'s attorney. 
If this is the case, [[I]] was hoping [[To]] reach him through you [[To]] see if he'd be willing [[To]] speak on the record about 
his ties - or previous ties - [[To]] both the Clintons and Donald Trump? 
Would you be able [[To]] arrange a call or email exchange this week? 
Thanks for your consideration.
