world, had to be deemed not torture and this is where organizations like the APA stepped in, then

psychologists loaned their names and loaned their credentials and their Ph.D.s to this kind of activity

the people who were, you know, doing these interrogations, because the logic, which I think Mark had

the SERE program who are on site at these interrogations who are saying that these detainees can 
withstand this treatment, are not being harmed psychologically, then it's not torture. So, you know,

lawyers loaning their credentials to approving what are clear violations of the Geneva Conventions."
