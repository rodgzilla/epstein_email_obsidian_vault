Understand the two negatives are still present. We are still on track per our last call of 60 days from 1/10 if we 
can get the placement out next week Christina is preparing for us and results continue to respond as they have 
been. 
It takes 30 days for Google to respond in most cases and we ramped up 28 days ago with boosting alternate 
URLs per our call 
We are working very hard to make this happen and should have Christina set up to support us with columns on 
a few top sites at no cost moving forward 
I am available for a call now or this weekend to review.

Thank you Christina - I tried your cell a few minutes ago and will be available on mine at your convenience. It 
is imperative we get a placement out by mid next week in order for us to hit the timeline I spoke to Mr. Epstein 
about.. The fresh piece needs to come out while we are dislodging the current results (as you are observing 
now). 
Mr. Epstein if you have any questions on current status vs. our conversation around Jan 10. please advise - We 
are continuing to work aggressively to clean up results per our last call. I am also available to discuss this at 
your convenience today or over weekend. 
Sincerely, 
Tyler Shears
