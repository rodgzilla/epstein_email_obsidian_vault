Dear Mr [[Epstein]], 
[[I]] write further [[To]] an email [[Sent]] [[To]] you earlier this month, concerning an article we are preparing for 
publication in which you may be mentioned. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030592 
We have not received a response [[From]] you. If you wish [[To]] respond, please do so as soon as possible and no 
later than 18:00 on Monday 2nd February 2015. 
For your convenience, please see the original letter below,. 
Yours faithfully,

Swiss Accounts Survey 
Dear Mr [[Epstein]], 
We are writing because a US media organisation, in concert with ourselves at the Guardian newspaper in 
London, is currently conducting a detailed survey of Swiss bank accounts, past and present. 
It is not illegal [[To]] have Swiss accounts. But as you may know, it is a topic of considerable public debate, and 
several governments have been investigating the owners of such accounts. 
There are a number of ways such accounts and also offshore trusts have been used [[To]] avoid inheritance tax, 
UK domestic tax, or tax imposed by other countries. Such accounts have also been used [[To]] launder money. 
We have seen records held in the US identifying you among those who have held accounts. These accounts 
contained assets of up [[To]] USD 3.5m, and include: 
HSBC (Suisse) SA 
FAMILY INTEREST [[L]].P. 
22079 
BESSIE 
[[Jeffrey]] [[Epstein]] 
[[1]]) You may therefore have been a person evading or avoiding tax, or laundering money. 
We will be particularly concerned with these questions: 
2) Why you had Swiss accounts. 
3) How much back tax you have settled with the tax authorities following their investigation of your affairs. 
Additionally, [[From]] public records and [[From]] material we have seen we note that: 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030593 
4) In 2008 you pleaded guilty [[To]] solicitation of prostitution and procuring minors for prostitution. You were 
sentenced [[To]] 18 months in prison. 
5) Your above accounts were also linked with Mr Leslie Wexner. 
6) You are known [[To]] be or have previously been closely associated with Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew and Kevin 
Spacey. 
7) You have made substantial contributions [[To]] the Clintons' philanthropic causes. Tax reform campaigners 
have previously been critical of those who engage in public life or the political process while avoiding or 
evading tax. Hilary Clinton herself, speaking in 2012, noted the importance of elites paying a substantial share 
of tax: "One of the issues that [[I]] have been preaching about around the world is collecting taxes in an 
equitable manner — especially [[From]] the elites in every country." 
It is intended shortly [[To]] publish the results of our survey in both the US and the UK. 
As responsible journalists acting in the public interest, we would first like [[To]] give you the opportunity [[To]] 
comment. 
If we do not hear [[From]] you by 18:00 on Monday 12th January 2015 (preferably by email [[To]] 
we shall proceed on the basis that you do not wish [[To]] comment on or amend 
our information. 
But we have approached you in a straightforward fashion and hope you will take this opportunity [[To]] respond 
if you wish. Your substantive responses [[To]] each of our numbered points will be carefully considered and 
published if appropriate. 
(For the avoidance of doubt, we do not normally regard any generalised assertion of "inaccuracies" as a 
substantive response; nor any generalised statement that the holders acted on advice. Neither will we regard 
as substantive any comment that only refers [[To]] the present state of affairs and not [[To]] the past.) 
We are, of course, happy [[To]] discuss directly any concerns you may have. 
We would be most grateful if you would acknowledge receipt of this letter. This will save us [[From]] chasing. 
Yours faithfully, 
[[David]] Pegg
