Hi [[Jeffrey]] ! 
Here is a short video of me sailing under Golden Gate Bridge with my Stanford friends. Really rett : 
can't express how happy [[I]] am [[To]] be here. Totally over the moon every day going [[To]] 
and exploring the area. 
Now [[I]]'m on the way [[To]] Tuscon [[To]] visit whose info [[I]] [[Sent]] you for assistant r,osition. She 
would love [[To]] pass interviews with you. She is smart and easy, her mum produced movie so 
knows a lot in film industry too besides other assets. 
What happens with zubair's project ? Do you believe it can be used in H.clinton's campaign or the Trump's 
one [[To]] help her/ him win elections ? His goal is [[To]] propose it [[To]] them [[To]] find out in which states, what 
kind of people should be targeted [[To]] collect votes. He says that his algorithms can figure reasons why a 
category of people vote against a candidate and [[To]] help candidate [[To]] adapt the campaign [[To]] the people's 
preferences...well, [[To]] win elections at the end!
