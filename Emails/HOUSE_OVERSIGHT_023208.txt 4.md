On different subject: general time frame is: docs (notes and purchase and sale agreement to you tomorrow 
end of biz); incorporate your comments monday and get docs to trust attorney tuesday; 
contemporaneously meet in person with you tuesday or wednesday and do a dry run. On these days ada 
will also take the trustees through outline of docs they will receive thursday. Docs to trustees, leon et al on 
thursday and signatures gathered by friday for first close 12/22. Tight but doable. Ada, alan agree? 
PS: ada, you shld begin to think abt where people are (jh, rr, bc, ldb) next week.
