Hi Dan,
Please explain why the DA's office didn't file a redacted brief, but rather covered up all the facts.
If we filed a petition for a redacted brief, would the DA's office fight it or cooperate?
Thank you,
Sue

Hi Sue - the document was filed under seal. I cannot violate the seal and provide it to you.
(off the record please) You may wish to petition the court, or have the Post's lawyer send our lawyers
something. We've reached the end of me being able to help - it's sealed.
