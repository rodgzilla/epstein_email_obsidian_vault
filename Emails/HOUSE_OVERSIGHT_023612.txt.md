Mr. Epstein:

Many, many thanks for your overwhelming generosity. and I flew home today with Mr. Farkas and 
his family. They took very good care of us and they couldn't have been nicer. Andrew and are still 
stuck in St. Thomas, enjoying the use of your car. 
We are extremely grateful for everything you have done for us. 
Happy New Year and hope to see you next time you are at Harvard. 
Fondly, 
Kelly Friendly
