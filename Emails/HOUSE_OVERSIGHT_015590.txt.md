Good morning,
I am advising of Judge Lynch's rulings on the above referenced case. His rulings are
as follows:
Non Party's motion to quash, or for protective order, regarding subpoena served on
non party law firm Boies Schiller: The subpoena, as to the law firm, is quashed
As to the "Jane Doe #3" subpoena: The motion is granted as to request #9, 17,
18, 20 and 23.
The motion is denied as to the other requests, but a confidentiality order shall be
entered.
Regarding the deposition: The depo shall be limited to 4 hours without prejudice to
request additional time in the future.
The Defendant can be present at the depo.
The depo will be taken at the law firm representing the witness.
There shall be a special master, paid by the Defendant, present at the depo, to rule
on objections.
The depo will be limited to the issues of this case without prejudice for another
depo, if required, in the future.
The issues and said limitations will be determined by the special master.
Each attorney who had a motion heard, is to prepare the order on their motion for
the judges signature, along with sufficient copies, self addressed, self stamped
envelopes for all parties.
These orders cannot be submitted through the order portal.
Respectfully,
Susan Moss
