It was fun and interesting. 
I admire your friends determination. 
Are you serious about working on this? 
Has anyone done a full analysis of this and polarization. 
Seems like on one hand it might encourage Ralph Nader cuz he d get more first round votes and not elect George 
bush. This might be bad. 
On other hand, gore would not have to move left to take Nader vote. 
If I like centrism is it clear that this is better. 
I get that it avoids arbitrary outcomes but assume that a tea party nut is as likely to elect a dem as a lefty is to elect et a 
republican. 
Anyway thanks for setting up. 
Btw I gave them 10,000.
