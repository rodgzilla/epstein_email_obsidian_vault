Books and newspaper accounts of Trump's 45 years in business were full of his 
shady dealings, and the presidency had only helped [[To]] highlight them and [[To]] surface even 
juicier ones. Real estate was the world's favorite money laundering currency and Trump's 
B[[-]]level real estate business was quite explicitly designed [[To]] appeal [[To]] money launderers. 
What's more, Trump's own financial woes, and desperate efforts [[To]] maintain billionaire 
lifestyle, cache, and market viability, forced him into constant and unsubtle 
schemes. Practically speaking, you couldn't miss him, as the Mueller investigation 
appeared [[To]] be finding. 
In November 2004, for instance, [[Jeffrey]] [[Epstein]], the financier later caught in a scandal 
involving under[[-]]age prostitutes, agreed [[To]] buy out of bankruptcy a house in Palm Beach, 
Florida for $30 million—a house that had been on the market for two years. [[Epstein]] and 
Trump had been close friends—playboys in arms, as it were—for more than a decade, 
with [[Epstein]] often counseling Trump on his chaotic financial affairs. [[Epstein]] took Trump 
[[To]] see the Palm Beach house [[To]] advise him on construction issues involved with moving a 
swimming pool. As he prepared [[To]] finalize his deal for the house, an incredulous [[Epstein]] 
saw a severely cash[[-]]constrained Trump bid $41 million for the property, buying it through 
an entity called Trump Properties LLC, financed by Deutsche Bank. Trump, [[Epstein]] knew, 
had been renting his name, telling [[Epstein]] he ought [[To]] do the same—that is, for an ample 
fee, Trump was willing [[To]] serve as a front man [[To]] disguise the actual ownership in a real 
estate transaction. (This was, in effect, just another variation of Trump's basic business 
model of licensing his name for commercial properties owned by someone else.) A furious 
[[Epstein]], suspecting that the real owner was a Russian oligarch, who Trump knew, Dmitry 
Rybolovlev—part of the close Putin circle of government[[-]]aligned industrialists in Russia—
threatened [[To]] expose the deal, then getting extensive scrutiny in Florida papers. The fight 
became all the more bitter when, two months later, the house was put on the market for 
$125 million. Well known [[To]] Trump, who often saw [[Epstein]] at his current Palm Beach 
house, [[Epstein]] was visited almost every day, and had been for many years, by [[Girls]] who he 
paid for massages with happy endings—[[Girls]] recruited [[From]] local restaurants, strip clubs, 
and, also, Trump's Mar[[-]]a[[-]]Lago. Just as the threats and enmity of the two friends increased 
over the house sale, [[Epstein]] found himself under investigation by local Palm Beach police. 
[[Epstein]]'s legal problems vastly escalated as the house, with only minor improvements, 
was bought for $96 million by Dmitry Rybolovlev. That is, Trump had either miraculously 
earned $55 million, without putting up a dime, or Rybolovlev, or someone such as 
Rybolovlev, paid Trump Properties, LLC—actual owner unknown—$96 million, thereby 
providing a clean payment of $55 million [[To]] someone. Rybolovlev might have, in effect, 
paid himself for the house, thereby cleansing the money. [[Epstein]], on his part, would spend 
12 months in jail on a prostitution charge.

After the election, when Bannon was introduced [[To]] [[Epstein]], Bannon told him, "You were 
the one person [[I]] was truly afraid of coming forward during the campaign." 
"And rightly so," said [[Epstein]].
