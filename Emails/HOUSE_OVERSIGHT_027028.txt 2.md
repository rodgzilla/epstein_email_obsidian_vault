Obama nominee Penny Pritzker's $80 million mistake 
President Obama's billionaire nominee to head the Commerce Department, Penny Prizker, understated her 
income by $80 million. 
Emily Heil 
Hey, these things happen: Penny Pritzker, President Obama's nominee to lead the Commerce Department, 
understated her income by some $80 million and had to file a correction to her government-filed 
disclosures, Bloomberg is reporting. 
That might sound like a lot of money, but it's all relative. Pritzker, whose family founded the Hyatt 
hotel chain, is worth about $1.5 billion. So it's easy to see how a few million — or 80 — could go 
missing. 
Maybe she left it in the other purse? 
A spokeswoman told Bloomberg that the $80 million was "a substantial amount" and that Pritzker's advisers 
corrected the error as soon as they realized it. 
Per Bloomberg: "Documents released last week show Pritzker received $32.2 million for a decade's worth of 
consulting on the restructuring of domestic trusts," but new filings indicated she made at least $80 
million more than that.
