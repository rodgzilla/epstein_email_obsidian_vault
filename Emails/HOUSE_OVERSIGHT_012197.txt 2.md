Barry is available Monday morning. Our most flexible West Palm Beach magistrate is on duty 
on Monday, so, assuming we have signed documents by 1:30 or so, we should be able to get Mr. 
Epstein arraigned on Monday. I doubt that we will be able to get everything finished up here, 
get down to Miami, and try to find a Miami mag by close of business on Monday.

Assistant U.S. Attorney
