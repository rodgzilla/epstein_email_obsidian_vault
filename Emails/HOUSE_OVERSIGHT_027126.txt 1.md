BREAKING NEWS 
Summers withdraws from Fed race 
Lawrence Summers has taken himself out of the running to be the 
next chair of the Federal Reserve, withdrawing his name after 
opposition from key Democratic senators indicated they would 
oppose his nomination. 
Mr Summers, a former Treasury Secretary and senior economic 
adviser to Barack Obama in his first term, galvanised opposition 
among left-of-centre Democrats who painted him as symbol of the 
wrongs of financial deregulation.
