Kirk: We had our June monthly ARCOM meeting yesterday. You likely know that ARCOM is working
with Mr. Trump to re-install a hedge on his North County Road property. I believe this case is now
pending in front of Code Enforcement. In May, ARCOM approved a plan to replace the former hedge
with silver buttonwood shrubbery, which would additionally be back-planted with silver buttonwood
trees....the overall effect would be an eventual 20' high screen. The shrubs have been planted, but
yesterday attorney Ray Royce asked for postponing the trees until the end of the Hurricane season.
ARCOM said NO and directed the attorney and landscaper to get the trees in ASAP. Also, more
shrubbery was required at the main entry (north side) to match the newly installed hedge on the south
side.
As the meeting was ending, the Commissioners asked for one of two things. They asked that either 1) a
quick written report from Code Enforcement be made available to them at their next meeting on July 23
(9:00 a.m.) about the enforcement status of the case, or 2) that someone from Code Enforcement attend
their meeting to provide a verbal status report. Their patience is wearing thin with the whole hedge issue,
and it has them naturally curious about what is happening with their counterparts on Code Enforcement.
Would you or the appropriate representative from Code Enforcement be available on July 23? That
would be my preference because follow-up questions almost always pop up. If not, can you provide me
with a brief summary of your enforcement history and pending status? Thanks, JP
