First draft: 
It is hard [[To]] know how [[To]] respond [[To]] a list of false and/or distorted allegations, along with misleading statements 
on your part. Needless [[To]] say, [[I]] treat people [[I]] interact with with respect, and [[I]] work hard [[To]] support and mentor 
students, colleagues, and members of the general public. [[I]] do not sexually harass people. If the purpose of your 
reporting is [[To]] somehow argue that that Universities and other institutions are lax in dealing with well known 
individuals like myself, then in fact the situation is quite the opposite. My high public profile opens me up [[To]] 
more scrutiny at these institutions, not less, and it also opens me up [[To]] a host of outside complaints and 
allegations that other faculty do not receive, each of which the University has [[To]] respond [[To]]. The fact that [[I]] have 
remained a professor in all Universities with which [[I]] have been associated, in good standing, and also an officer 
or an invited speaker at organizations like CFI, which have strict harassment policies, is a confirmation of the 
fact that they trust my behavior. [[I]] was asked [[To]] be an honorary director of CFI, and invited [[To]] their last 3 
meetings [[To]] speak, specifically because, as they have written me after the fact, the attendees universally 
appreciated my talks, my courtesy, and graciousness in spending time with the attendees. If the purpose of your 
report is [[To]] impugn my integrity or suggest [[I]] have a history of harassment, that too is false. As noted in one of 
your 'miscellaneous facts', as a scientist [[I]] try and remain skeptical, and rely on empirical evidence, rather than 
allegations and innuendo. [[I]] also try and judge the facts in context. The fact that Universities and other 
organizations employ me or have me on their boards, or invite me [[To]] meetings is because they value my 
contributions and my actions. 
Your specific allegations are false or distorted. Item [[1]] refers [[To]] a consensual encounter in my hotel room in 
2006 where we mutually decided, in a polite discussion in fact, that taking it any further would not be 
appropriate, and had respectful encounters afterwards. [[I]] cannot comment on item 3, which involves an 
anonymous 3rd party claim, because [[I]] know nothing about it, and it was not taken seriously enough [[To]] result in 
any university action. Item 4 is confusing. Are you saying that because [[I]] decided [[I]] didn't want [[To]] go out [[To]] a 
bar with a group of attendees that [[I]] was harassing them? The second part is false. [[I]] don't do that. Re incident 
5: The 'female companion' in this case is my wife, who can attest [[To]] the fact that the claim is false, which is 
what [[I]] [[Wrote]] in response [[To]] the blog in question, causing it [[To]] be taken down. 
It is worthwhile responding [[To]] Item 2 and 6 in more detail, 
Re item 2: the student in question was interested in science communication, and on dozens of occasions came 
[[To]] me or [[Wrote]] [[To]] me with questions. When she asked about advice for after graduation [[I]] DID tell her she was 
different than the other students in her year. The rest of them were interested in going on [[To]] graduate school, 
but she was interested in science communication so [[I]] told her that she might want [[To]] take a different path. Since 
she was the only woman in her year, as [[I]] recall, [[I]] did ask her on one of these occasions if that made it difficult 
for her in any way. [[I]] asked, because as a faculty member [[I]] was interested, and also because as someone she had 
asked for career advice [[From]] [[I]] wanted [[To]] know if that made a difference [[To]] her. Re asking her for dinner.. [[I]] have 
gone back over emails [[From]] that period. [[I]] have numerous requests [[From]] her [[To]] go for coffee [[To]] talk, which [[I]] 
usually had [[To]] turn down because [[I]] was busy, including several occasions where she asked me [[To]] have coffee 
with her off campus [[To]] talk, and [[I]] politely declined. [[I]] did let her accompany me off campus one time [[To]] watch 
me do a BBC interview because she specifically requested it. [[I]] did and do have coffee and meals with students 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031239 
on campus, and [[I]] see nothing wrong with this. [[I]] was shocked when [[I]] later learned of her complaint, not least 
because there was no inappropriate interaction and also because well after the [[Date]] on which she is said [[To]] have 
been offended, she continued [[To]] email me with joking questions or comments, and at a AAAS conference in 
2008, for which she had asked, and for which [[I]] had written her a letter of recommendation [[To]] attend, my wife 
and [[I]] gave her a lift well out out of our way [[To]] drop her off at her hotel, and [[I]] note in an email response [[To]] her 
email about the conference, agin in 2008, [[I]] expressed that [[I]] would pass her regards along [[To]] my wife and vice 
versa. When the University informed me of the complaint [[I]] was shocked and concerned. When [[I]] spoke [[To]] 
the human resources person, including relating my concerns and providing the emails in question, [[I]] was told 
that no formal complaint of sexual harassment was deemed [[To]] be warranted in this case, and that the young 
woman in question had agreed [[To]] that. By that time [[I]] learned of the complaint [[I]] had already announced my 
intentions [[To]] leave Case [[To]] accept an offer at ASU—a very difficult decision for me because of my long-
standing attachment [[To]] the University, and the excellent relations [[I]] had with my colleagues there, both among 
the faculty and among the administration. Because [[I]] was already in Arizona at the time [[I]] was asked not [[To]] have 
any further interaction with the student [[I]] agreed [[To]] that request because it was basically moot. [[I]] was also told 
that because it was being handled informally, that (a) it should remain confidential, which [[I]], at least abided by, 
and (b) if no further complaints were lodged in that case, that the University would remove the allegation [[From]] 
my record after 5 years, which makes me surprised that someone violated that written agreement with you. 
Re item 6: You report on ASU's response [[To]] item #6 , without including the fact that the University specifically 
stated there were never any allegations of sexual misconduct or harassment by me at the University, and the 
outside complaints were in fact related specifically [[To]] your item #6. Further you neglect [[To]] mention that this 
complaint was by an anonymous third party, not the individual who was allegedly harassed, who never lodged a 
complain, and that no specific evidence was provided of the alleged transgression. [[I]] was surprised and 
dismayed that both ASU and ANU launched investigations on the basis of this but was told by both Universities 
that because of my high profile even such unsubstantiated third party complaints at private events unrelated [[To]] 
the University would be investigated. The complaint was investigated throughly by both ASU and ANU and 
both came [[To]] the conclusion that it was not credible and no university policies had been violated. . In addition 
ANU's investigation, which took a full month found significant inconsistencies in the allegation, suggesting 
distortion and fabrication, [[I]] will quote [[From]] the ANU report. The initial complaint, which in fact resulted in a 
temporary suspension by ANU outlined the claim you made in the words you quoted in your note [[To]] me, along 
with the statement made in the complaint that 
"It is the University's understanding that a complaint was lodged directly [[To]] the conference organisers at the 
time of the incident." 
After the investigation, the final report absolved me of any wrongdoing, and indicated information inconsistent 
with the original claim and apparent later claims as follows: 
"The allegations were made by an observer [[To]] the incident. 
- The complaint did not identify, nor disclose the identity of the conference attendee who was allegedly touched 
in 
an unwelcome manner. 
- The conference attendee who took the `selfie' photo did not lodge a formal complaint [[To]] the conference 
organisers 
at the time of the incident (November 2016). 
- The conference attendee who witnessed the incident, did not lodge a formal complaint [[To]] the conference 
organisers 
at the time of the incident (November 2016). 
The photo submitted as part of the complaint does not provide evidence of any physical contact. 
- The complainant alleged that a photo exists, showing your hand on the breast of the conference attendee who 
took 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031240 
the `selfie' photo. This photo was not made available [[To]] the Australian National University, although it was 
requested 
in the course of the investigation." 
(And for the record [[I]] often put my hand up in front of a camera if there is a flash, as [[I]] specifically request selfies 
not [[To]] include flashes, so that [[I]] don't end up with a series bright spots in front of my eyes for the next half hour) 
What makes this particular type of allegation so repugnant is that [[I]] get asked for literally thousands of selfies, 
and when people come up [[To]] me they are vulnerable, often shaking, and sometimes overly aggressive. [[I]] am 
particularly proud of the way [[I]] attempt [[To]] make all people feel at ease, and respected, rather than humiliated. 
Thus, this false claim strikes at the heart of what [[I]] am about, which is [[To]] acknowledge fans in a way that makes 
them feel appreciated. As [[I]] understand you had a reporter watching me sign books and take selfies at the CFI 
conference in Las Vegas this year, that behavior is what they will have witnessed. Moreover, [[I]] am proud of the 
interactions [[I]] have had at both Case and ASU, with students, colleagues and staff. [[I]] have had numerous female 
graduate students, postdocs, employees, and colleagues, and as ASU attested [[To]] you, none of these have ever 
complained of harassment. Quite the contrary in fact, as [[I]] have worked hard [[To]] support them, mentor them, and 
treat them with respect. [[I]] treat others as responsible adults, and [[I]] expect [[To]] be treated equally.
