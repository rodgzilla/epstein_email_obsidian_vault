Lawyers for Imam Wanted by Turkish 
Authorities Fear for Their Client's Life 
Fethullah Gulen has been accused by Turkish President Erdogan of 
ordering the launch of July coup

Lawyers for the imam living in Pennsylvania whom Turkish authorities accuse of directing a coup last month in 
that country said Friday they fear for his life and may ask U.S. authorities [[To]] help protect him. 
Since the failed coup that led [[To]] the deaths of 271 people, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused 
the imam, Fethullah Gulen, of issuing instructions [[To]] launch the coup, a charge Mr. Gulen has denied. 
Turkish authorities have demanded the U.S. extradite Mr. Gulen immediately [[To]] Turkey, but The Wall Street 
Journal reported Thursday that U.S. officials don't expect [[To]] do that, citing people familiar with the discussions. 
U.S. officials see problems with the evidence presented thus far by Turkey, and they are concerned 
about strident public statements made by Turkish leaders against Mr. Gulen, those people said. 
Mr. Erdogan has called Mr. Gulen and his supporters a terrorist network, a charge U.S. officials have long 
discounted. Turkey in May officially designated Mr. Gulen's network a terrorist organization, making 
membership a crime under Turkish law. 
Mr. Erdogan's government has pressed the Obama administration since the coup [[To]] extradite Mr. Gulen, 
arguing that pursuing the imam is part of the broader campaign against terrorism. At times, the Turkish leader's

aides have said Ankara would view as hostile any foreign government that gave sanctuary [[To]] leaders of the 
Gulen movement. 
Turkey hasn't yet made a formal extradition request [[To]] the U.S., and Turkish officials say they plan [[To]] provide 
more evidence [[To]] the Justice Department. 
Mr. Gulen, 75 years old, came [[To]] the U.S. in 1999, and has a devoted following in Turkey and other countries. 
At a press conference in Washington on Friday, Mr. Gulen's lawyers said they have spoken [[To]] the Justice 
Department about the demands for extradition but are unaware of the U.S. government's thinking or plans. 
Asked if they feared for his life, one of Mr. Gulen's lawyers, [[Reid]] [[Weingarten]] said, "We do. We're very 
concerned about his safety." The lawyer said they are discussing whether [[To]] ask U.S. authorities for help in 
safeguarding their client. 
A Turkish court has issued a warrant for Mr. Gulen's arrest, and Turkish and U.S. authorities have privately 
discussed scenarios in which Mr. Gulen might be extradited. But several U.S. officials said they cannot now 
envision a scenario in which they turn him over [[To]] Turkey. 
"It would be unprecedented and appalling if the U.S. took a frail, almost octogenarian, plopped him on a plane 
[[To]] go back into that kind of setting with the hideous things that are being said about him by the entire Turkish 
government," said Mr. [[Weingarten]]. 
"The bluster, the conspiracy theories, and the threats of Mr. Erdogan are not strong enough [[To]] overwhelm the 
American legal system," he added. "And for that reason we believe that Mr. Gulen should not and will not be 
extradited." 
Mr. [[Weingarten]] said the chances that his client helped plot a coup [[From]] his base in the Poconos is "about as 
likely" as a meteor striking the lawyer's office while he was speaking.
