Jeffrey 
While Trump is in PSI, TSA only allows arrival and departures between Sam and 5pm for General Aviation. 
I made a resv for Nov 26th at Sam to St Thomas„ 
Passengers: You and 
I can make passenger changes up to 24 Hours before Departure, they also request if we are traveling with 
an animal., FYI, 
They also ask if Passengers are Male or Female, strange, they didn't ask names. 
Thx 
Larry
