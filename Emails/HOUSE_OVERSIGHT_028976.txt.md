Dear [[Jeffrey]], 
Woody has received [[From]] his lawyer some questions [[I]] asked in in response [[To]] the agreement Irwin Tenenbaum 
[[Sent]] me... .[[1]] found that that agreement generous and reasonable (!), and [[I]]'m excited [[To]] go forward, but [[I]] do need 
those clarifications. We can absolutely agree that we will not give Woody larger or more important billing than 
Bill Clinton or Joe Biden, and that [[I]]'d like [[To]] come [[To]] him [[To]] renew our agreement after five years. 
The Harvard week of content in which Woody will appear, if we can sign this, needs [[To]] be edited in the next 
week[[-]]10 days. We are out of time, which is why [[I]]'m writing 
The television show has been picked up by American Public Television, they will distribute nationally, and 
they've asked for another 5 episodes. [[I]] so want Woody [[To]] be one of those. 
[[I]]'d like [[To]] see the haiku written by computer. Haiku is not that hard. [[I]]'d like [[To]] see an elegy written by 
computer.
