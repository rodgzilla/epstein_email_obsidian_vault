Dave, 
Talk about a small world. [[I]] got on the airplane Saturday night and opened up the Palm Beach newspaper and 
here's what [[I]] found (see attached). Remember "Bear", Warren's friend [[From]] NY. Well, he is a Billionaire 
(Literally and really) and always seems [[To]] be in the news in South Florida. He competes with Trump on big 
property deals and seems [[To]] be quite the womanizer. The only problem is he goes after some of the young ones 
sometimes and must not check there ID's. 
Oh well, [[I]] thought you might get a kick out of this article. What a small world. 
Take good care!!
