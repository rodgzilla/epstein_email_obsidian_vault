Hi Jeffrey 
I hope I'm not bothering you, but this is information I think you need to know. Tina Brown has assigned a 1200 to 1500 
word story with pictures about you for Newsweek and the deadline is next Wednesday. My good friend Alexandra Wolfe 
is writing the story; she called me within an hour of getting this assignment. If you hire me I feel confident that I can 
positively affect this feature on your behalf. That does not mean I can control it completely or that they won't reference 
past problems. However, I can assure you that the story will be fair and balanced and that your side will be represented 
intelligently. The story will be about your reemergence in New York post your previous problems. The party you gave for 
Prince Andrew will be a big part of it. I suggest we arrange for interviews with figures who have seen the good things that 
you have done in business, science, and philanthropy. I'll be home after 7:30 tonight. My home number is 
, or you can call my cell at . I will also be in tomorrow morning. I suggest you act swiftly in this matter. 
As I told you when we first met this story wont go away and you need to take positive steps to change your image. 
Cheers, 
Couri
