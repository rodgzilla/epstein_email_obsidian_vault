Marie - I, too, am interested in speed. But I really need to go over this and 
then discuss with Jeffrey. So please do not send this to any Special Master 
before we discuss the next steps. 
Thanks -- Jay

Subject RE: Conference Call with Bert Ocariz 
, 
15:ime§ageiba&beer.r:orwar. 
Hi Jay — I already told Bert that there is no indictment and, as I mentioned, he doesn't really 
need to/want to see the entire plea agreement, .just the relevant paragraphs so that he understands 
what the scope of his representation will be. I think they would be happy knowing that their 
hourly rate will be paid when it is billed. The concern is, if all 40 girls decide they want to sue, 
they don't want to be in a situation where Mr. Epstein says this is getting too expensive, we won' 
t pay any more attorneys' fees. 
Two suggestions, that I haven't run past Bert, are: 
1. Mr. Epstein signs a standard fee agreement, where one of his attorneys or 
accountants who is not working on the damages litigation receives a monthly bill with 
attorney's fees charged at an hourly rate and costs billed monthly. The bills will have 
any privileged information redacted. If there is a dispute about a bill that cannot be 
resolved, it will be submitted to a mediator for resolution. 
2. If that is too open-ended for Mr. Epstein, do the hourly/monthly billing until Berl. 
has had a chance to confer with all of the girls to determine how many want him to 
represent them. Once it is known how many girls will be represented by Bert, and maybe 
who those girls are, there can be a more educated discussion about estimated fees and 
costs. 
Just some food for thought. I will be out of the office tomorrow, but I will be reachable by cell 
Phone. I will make sure Bert is available and confirm the time with you.
