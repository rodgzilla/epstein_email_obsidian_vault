ok.. [[I]] just [[Sent]] an additional email which moderates this.. everyone was a victim, including [[Jeffrey]] here.. and 
there was no happy resolution.. please add.. "probably everyone was a victim, with no happy resolution or 
consequences of these activities", after "was the victim in this case.".

Okay, thanks for this statement . . . [[I]]'ll print it in full along with the article, probably today. [[I]] very, very 
strongly disagree with your position and hope you eventually reconsider, but [[I]] do appreciate you taking the 
time [[To]] respond.

[[Jeffrey]] apparently paid for massages with sex... [[I]] believe him when he told me he had no idea the [[Girls]] were 
underage, and [[I]] doubt that people normally are asked for or present a driver's license under such 
circumstances... Moreover, [[I]] also believe that [[Jeffrey]] is an easy target for those who want [[To]] take advantage 
of him... Moreover, [[I]] can say with great honesty that [[Jeffrey]]'s time in prison led him [[To]] seriously examine 
his life in very positive ways and [[I]] don't believe in blanket condemnations of people. He served time for 
something that was determined was inappropriate. [[I]] honestly don't know who was the victim in this case. [[I]] 
fully expect that these masseuses knew what they were doing, and were not swayed [[To]] do anything with 
[[Jeffrey]] that they were not already doing. That is not [[To]] approve of the whole behavior, but lots of peopleI 
know and like have behavior [[I]] don't entirely approve of. [[I]] know it is not politically correct [[To]] say that, 
because in general this is a very sensitive issue and all other things being equal one should take the side of 
the young women. But all things are not equal in this case, [[From]] my point of view. It is a judgement call, 
and [[I]] will not turn my back on a good friend so easily.

Thanks for getting back [[To]] me. [[I]] was asking because [[I]] found the quote shocking . . . the evidence against 
[[Epstein]] is overwhelming and he's even pled guilty [[To]] paying for sex with a minor. It's in no way scientific or 
rational [[To]] assume that because you never saw him with an underage girl he must actually be innocent. It is 
possible for a person [[To]] be kind and generous with his friends but still a criminal paying for sex with 
underage [[Girls]] in his private life. 
[[I]]'m going [[To]] write about the topic on Skepchick, and [[I]]'ll include any additional statement you'd like if you 
want [[To]] provide more context or if you've changed your mind.

[[Yes]] it is.. Based on my direct experience with [[Jeffrey]], which is all [[I]] can base my assessment on, he is a 
thoughtful, kind, considerate man who is generous [[To]] his friends, and all of the women [[I]] have known who 
have been associated with [[Jeffrey]] speak glowingly in the same words.. 
why are you asking?

Dear Professor Krauss, 
We met briefly after your talk in Ithaca a few months ago — [[I]]'m the girl on The Skeptics' Guide [[To]] the 
Universe podcast. [[I]]'ve really enjoyed your talks and books, but [[I]] was surprised [[To]] see you quoted in the 
Daily Beast recently defending [[Jeffrey]] [[Epstein]]: 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030900 
http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2011-04-01/bill-clinton-katie-couric-woody-allen-jeffrey-
epsteins[[-]]society[[-]]friends[[-]]close[[-]]ranks/2/  
Can you confirm if the following quote is accurate? 
"If anything, the unfortunate period he suffered has caused him [[To]] really think about what he wants [[To]] do 
with his money and his time, and support knowledge," says Krauss. "[[Jeffrey]] has surrounded himself with 
beautiful women and young women but they're not as young as the ones that were claimed. As a scientist [[I]] 
always judge things on empirical evidence and he always has women ages 19 [[To]] 23 around him, but [[I]]'ve 
never seen anything else, so as a scientist, my presumption is that whatever the problems were [[I]] would 
believe him over other people." Though colleagues have criticized him over his relationship with [[Epstein]], 
Krauss insists, "[[I]] don't feel tarnished in any way by my relationship with [[Jeffrey]]; [[I]] feel raised by it." 
Thanks, 
[[Rebecca Watson]]
