My sister's in a wheelchair the cancer is getting worse, she's just about done, so trying to spend some time 
with her. My mother's alzheimer's has gotten worse, but it's not so bad, I tell her whatever I want her to know, 
like my father is off at work and coming home soon and I have a beautiful wife and 3 kids that very much 
enjoyed her company yesterday and she's happy, so I've figured out how to manage that one. Otherwise no 
news, going to Brazil in a few weeks. If you're still interested in Joy I'll let them know, I remember they wanted 
to meet you at Paris when they went for VS show, so not sure what their future plans are, but Marcelo - one 
of the owners/investors - will probably try to impress you Brazilian style (over-stating/inflating everything), 
but the girls are there and they're trying to network in Eastern Europe, so if you get involved for that reason 
alone I guess you'll be satisfied at the end of the day. 
Congrats on your Trump.... but if any of that is true I guess he will be impeached (fingers crossed, lo1).
