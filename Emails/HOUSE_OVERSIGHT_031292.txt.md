My sister's in a wheelchair the cancer is getting worse, she's just about done, so trying [[To]] spend some time 
with her. My mother's alzheimer's has gotten worse, but it's not so bad, [[I]] tell her whatever [[I]] want her [[To]] know, 
like my father is off at work and coming home soon and [[I]] have a beautiful wife and 3 kids that very much 
enjoyed her company yesterday and she's happy, so [[I]]'ve figured out how [[To]] manage that one. Otherwise no 
news, going [[To]] Brazil in a few weeks. If you're still interested in Joy [[I]]'ll let them know, [[I]] remember they wanted 
[[To]] meet you at Paris when they went for VS show, so not sure what their future plans are, but Marcelo - one 
of the owners/investors - will probably try [[To]] impress you Brazilian style (over[[-]]stating/inflating everything), 
but the [[Girls]] are there and they're trying [[To]] network in Eastern Europe, so if you get involved for that reason 
alone [[I]] guess you'll be satisfied at the end of the day. 
Congrats on your Trump.... but if any of that is true [[I]] guess he will be impeached (fingers crossed, lo1).
