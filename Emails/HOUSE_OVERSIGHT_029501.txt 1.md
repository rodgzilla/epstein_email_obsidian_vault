Hi [[Alan]] 
[[I]] was reading through the files related [[To]] the [[Jeffrey]] [[Epstein]] case, including the original criminal case where 
you defended Mr. [[Epstein]], and saw a letter both you and Gerald Lefcourt co[[-]]authored on his behalf dated July 
6, 2007. 
The letter said "Mr. [[Epstein]] was part of the original group that conceived the Clinton Global Initiative, which is 
described as a project 'bringing together a community of global leaders [[To]] devise and implement innovative 
solutions [[To]] some of the world's most pressing challenges.' Focuses of this initiative include poverty, climate 
change, global health, and religious and ethnic conflicts." 
[[I]] just wanted [[To]] clarify if Mr. [[Epstein]] was on the board of directors or listed as a founder anywhere or on any 
paperwork associated with the foundation and if so, in what capacity. Also wanted [[To]] clarify what you 
specifically mean by being part of the original group. 
[[I]] attached a screen shot of the exact passage [[I]] am referring [[To]]. 
Thanks, 
Malia
