Transaction complete ! 
. this - in spite of your collection of Elysium misfits. !!! 
With Brad out of the office and unable to run his usual interference , the level of his utter incompetence was 
brought front and center, he may be a step up from Eileen, but if he is, then it is not certainly not by much, . 
Though you and I have spent many many hours discussing the importance of details and mechanics. I was not 
shown one document re phaidon,- not one.. Brad wanted to keep it private between he and his so called" 
advisors" however as he was out of the office during the most important transaction of the year, I did get 
to spend time with joslin Joe and john, - the situation in your office is wholly ludicrous - to summarize - the 
list I provided to Brad last December - things I thought were a priority to get done after consulting with your 
office still remains virtually undone. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023304 
IT, still desperately needed- reporting flawed cumbersome and inaccurate . all done by hand as one -off 
exercises , - airplane: re structure, (my only suggested priority in june ) is really ,no further ahead, consultants 
up the kazoo but nothing at all done.( the office was told that i cannot even see the proposals received without 
brads specific authorization ) - brad has no idea even as to what questions to ask. he knows little of finance, is 
run roughshod over by almost everyone in the office. he is a little man , using your power, to appear larger. 
Eileen was self aware enough to know she was over her head , that is a huge difference. bad info is 
rampant ie 3 million in deductions Im told are taken for art space but on closer examination it turns out 
they cannot be used at all. ( ZERO benefit ) though you will be told yes they were deducted on the return they 
said that is the question they get asked ! " were they deducted " not 2 is there a benefit" !! I asked for the 
balance sheet and P and L for Regan arts , a basic first step in order to check your financials. "sorry we never 
got one?" though 9.8 million invested, no p&l, nothing, a construction project run amok, no budget, the coo 
fired after only 3 months. , no clue . I can add that artspace financials are also a total mess. 
As your friend and in order toturn the page. I will try to be constructive 
The following is a list of things I think would be in your interest to get done asap .but definitely not by me 
i suggest you form new grats. , hire a high level tax partner. use your trading accounts as they remain 
the paramount requirement 16 months after i emailed to you their importance. , I suggest you 
consider having the 49percent of phaidon merged into artspance and have Richard buy artspace. re-do bank 
loans, no need to pay interest at higher rates on boat or plane. . as Richard is now no longer trustee. re- do 
will, make suydam executor , with Barry, and john as back up. pay 1 million a year for executor role. get rid 
of Judy Black trust, deal with gifts and their tax returns, . review amounts to kids at fixed ages. put more 
protections in for Alex and Victoria. , distribute some money to kids let them make decisions. , decide art 
division with children in attendance . have fire drill done on estate. fill out estate returns as if you and Debra 
died today, choose advisers - rick bronstein said the only 1040 he ever filled out was his own. ( this is brads 
chosen advisor??!) Halperin has a conflict that should be addressed., Debra should enter a tenants in common 
agreement with kids. you have airplane consultants tax consultants it consultants. plane operation consultant. 
. boat consultants. architects, lighting , art, legal, . foundation, deal with TRA , BRH , rationalize 
investments, cash flow, reporting, gaming disclosures, foreign, gift. . prepare tax projections for 15 and 16,. 
deal with neg basis ( tufts gain, debt financed, art partnership, pledges. sell stock, art, deal with phaidon 
debt. athene,? income, capital, foreign, exit, corporate, insurance regs, out and inbound 
issues, basis, appropriate discount rates. ? terminations. control. , qualified dividends, corporate 
tolls, inversion rules. , grat issues, short swing and other sec disclosures, Rothshcild bank, 150 b they have a 
distribution network with no products , private bank Rockefeller Rothschild. financial service, deal with UK 
visa issue sooner rather than later. we can talk about Rowen request re Athene , 2 billion in taxes on 
transaction. ?! 
the facts as i see them 
in June and then again Sept, we both agreed to a 50% of phaidon payout., then after weeks of thinking about 
the issue ( which I fully understand ) . the payout was unilaterally changed. 5m woudl be reserved for the 
future ? . and out of the remaining 15m,? i would receive only 5. ( note : I'm confident that both the debt, and 
the artspace investment will also lead to a write off of another 30 m. plus ) In my dining room ,you were 
surprised when I said that i require most people to pay their advisory fee up front so that I am assured that I 
will be properly compensated for my work when strategies that I devise are implemented. you may recall that 
you appeared offended and said " are you suggesting that i would go back on my word" I said no , of course 
not ! you are my closest of friends ,but my experience is that when amounts get large, people tend to get 
unhappy when it actually comes time for them to pay,. 
From day zero a 50 - 60 million price was attached as the fair price of the transaction just completed . 
though this amount was already substantially less thanour agreed and negotiated formula. - I was 
never told that this was out of range. in fact, alternative methods of payment. plane -in-kind etc, were 
discussed ( ie keeping the 30m portion of fee outstanding till March ) ,I provided as requested a 
detailed step by step execution plan and reviewed all documents that i was given access to. ( Phaidon was not 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023305 
forthcoming ) in order to make my many corrections. I was then told that Alans involvement warranted a 
discount. Even in the best of light , though it is beyond question that not one-,not -one time in three 
years has he ever proposed a unique idea. (including the new tenant in common idea,) and lets say he made 
a contribution to the plan andeven that it was 50 %. though no one could posit such a large amount unless they 
were wearing a brightly colored clown suit. , the price of doing the deal was known . It had both sent in 
writing and spoken about on the phone numerous times, a detailed execution plan was provided. then and 
only then after all was laid out for the group I was told that after a number of conversations with brad karp 
that only 20m would be paid, (and even that was more than originally contemplated ) for both transactions . I 
feel It was remarkably unfair. Did brad even know of our prior agreement.? I called him and he said he was 
never told.?, I would ask that you I and Brad karp sit together if you think it would be helpful. . I would like to 
send him this email, with your consent of course. If the transactions were never consummated, i would not be 
owed a dime, however , the price was known up front. , the detailed step by step plan was followed and 
overseen by me, the price that had been requested before the transaction was begun, and had 'ready heavily 
discounted, out of friendship, from our agreement. I believe the decision re paying only 20 m has frankly 
left me felling quite uneasy.

Last year you asked, for my help I told you I preferred not as we would be better off having no financial 
intereactions. the risk was not worth it. You told me that as my friend i had to do it I agreed., here we are 
in what I find to be an awkward situation. the transactions that i decvised were used , our agreement was 
ignored. and im not sure how to respond.
