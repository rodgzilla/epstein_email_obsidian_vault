am looking at this [[From]] over here in Germany. American politics gets reduced in the end [[To]] only a few 
issues: pro[[-]]life or pro[[-]]choice, gun laws, and establishment vs. anti[[-]]establishment. Political categories 
are so wishy washy and intermingled with what is termed 'liberal' and 'conservative' that one forgets 
what they actually mean. 
of course, not everybody who voted for Trump is sexist or a racist, but, on some level, they didn't care 
if he is. He knew how [[To]] gather momentum with the discourse he chose, and, even if he changes his tone, 
he has let loose a storm. We will brace ourselves over here for Putin's eventual takeover of the Baltic 
States. Putin has extended his power back into Republic of Georgia, the Crimea, and Armenia. Trump has 
said that he would not come [[To]] the aid of Nato allies if they were attacked. Is is the least of our 
problems here in Germany; Erdogan is a much larger threat, for now. 
don't see Hillary Clinton as being at fault. [[I]] see the growth of nationalism (all throughout the world, 
not just in the USA) and an underestimation of the fear that non[[-]]Hispanic whites have about the 
trajectory they are on [[To]] become a minority (in the USA and other European countries). 
Every news show, talk show, etc here is discussing and analysing the fallout of Trump's win. German 
politicians are hoping [[To]] learn [[From]] it, [[To]] stem the growth of the right wing AFD party here. As far as 
know, Merkel is the only leader who congratulated Trump with a warning.
