Is UNRWA vital for the Palestinians' future? 
A great international hue and cry followed the 
Trump administration's announcement the U.S. 
would no longer fund the UN Relief and Works  
Agency (UNWRA) because it is an 
"irredeemably flawed operation." Historically, 
the United States was the organization's 
biggest funder — in 2017, the U.S. covered 
nearly one[[-]]third of the agency's budget of $[[1]].[[1]]

ceasing payments altogether.

How Obama Blew the Chance for Economic Peace 
by [[Mitchell Bard]] 
Iln 2009, Barack Obama had an 
unprecedented opportunity [[To]] advance the 
peace process between Israel and the 
Palestinians. For the first time, the 
Palestinians had a prime minister who was 
respected and admired by the Israelis, 
because he did not come [[From]] the same 
terrorist background as Yasser Arafat and 
Mahmoud Abbas. Unlike his ideological 
comrades who insisted on "liberating Palestine," Salam Fayyad, was 
interested in building the infrastructure for a future state, 
strengthening the West Bank economy, and improving the lives of the 
Palestinian people.

Views on Israel of U.S. Presidential Candidates 2020:  
Joe Biden  
Former Vice President Joseph Robinette Biden, Jr., was born 
November 20, 1942, in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the first of four 
siblings. In 1953, the Biden family moved [[From]] Pennsylvania [[To]] 
Claymont, Delaware. He graduated [[From]] the University of Delaware 
and Syracuse Law School. 
One of his first overseas visits as a senator was [[To]] Israel, on the eve 
of the 1973 Yom Kippur War during which he met GoIda Meir. "She 
read letters and told me how this young man or woman had died and 
this is their family. This went on for [[I]] don't know how long, and [[I]] guess 
she could tell [[I]] was visibly moved by this, and [[I]] was getting depressed 
about it." The Prime Minister said, "Senator, don't look so sad... .we 
have a secret weapon in our confrontation in this part of the world. 
And [[I]] thought she was about [[To]] lean over and tell me about a new 
system or something... .she said, our secret weapon, Senator, is we 
have no place else [[To]] go. We have no place else [[To]] go."
