Apologies for requesting support in what was originally intended as an update on work done 
[[I]] am done with that, you will receive no more messages [[From]] me regarding funding, [[I]] am most grateful for your 
help—without it, [[I]] doubt [[I]] would have a book in view on Honour killings—[[I]] can finish it on my own and fully 
intend [[To]] 
you once said you would "never not support me" but never, as we both know, is a very long time—[[I]] am much 
more scared of Trump's capacity [[To]] destroy the stock market—but as long as [[I]] do not get orders [[From]] you [[To]] 
sell, [[I]] will ride it out 
[[I]] hope everything is good in your life 
warmest best, [[As Always]]
