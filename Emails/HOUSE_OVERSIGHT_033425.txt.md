Apologies for requesting support in what was originally intended as an update on work done 
i am done with that, you will receive no more messages from me regarding funding, i am most grateful for your 
help—without it, i doubt i would have a book in view on Honour killings—i can finish it on my own and fully 
intend to 
you once said you would "never not support me" but never, as we both know, is a very long time—i am much 
more scared of Trump's capacity to destroy the stock market—but as long as i do not get orders from you to 
sell, i will ride it out 
i hope everything is good in your life 
warmest best, as always
