Dear Jeff, 
Your name popped up again in the Press and [[I]] thought it was time [[To]] congratulate you on your wonderful 
financial successes since your days as my Physics prof at Dalton!! The young, bright options trader, who 
understood Black Sholes and how [[To]] use it, at Bear, made good!! 
Unless your PR advisor is Donald Trump, [[I]] am not sure that current press provides you with much benefit. 
Perhaps [[I]] am wrong? Not the first time!! 
Anyway, middle age has brought its own unique set of challenges. Aging certainly ain't for sissy's. 
Regards, 
[[Jamie Rosenwald]] 
Ps. [[David]] Asch and [[I]] toasted [[To]] you during our Thanksgiving weekend in Amagansett in November.
