Lawyers for U.S.-based 
Turkish cleric fear attacks 
on his life 
WASHINGTON BY JULIA HARTE 
Lawyers for U.S.-based Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen said on Friday 
they feared attacks on his life following Turkey's demands that he be 
extradited [[To]] face allegations that he ordered a failed coup against the 
government last month. 
The lawyers said they expected Gulen, who has denied any 
involvement in the July 15 coup attempt, will remain in his remote 
mountain compound in Pennsylvania.

"We have read concerns [[From]] Turkey that Mr. Gulen, this elderly, frail 
religious leader, is going [[To]] flee [[To]] another country," said Steptoe & 
Johnson LLP attorney [[Reid]] [[Weingarten]] on Friday, calling such 
allegations "absurd." 
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has blamed Gulen for the violence, 
in which Erdogan said 237 people were killed excluding the plotters 
and more than 2,100 wounded, and said the United States should 
extradite him [[To]] Turkey. The U.S. government has not done so, and 
the dispute has raised questions about relations between the two allies. 
Turkey, a member of the NATO alliance, hosts American troops and 
warplanes at Incirlik Air Base, an important staging area for the U.S.-
led fight against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. 
At a news conference in Washington, [[Weingarten]] and [[Michael]] [[Miller]], 
another Steptoe attorney, said evidence [[From]] a 2015 case financed by 
the Turkish government against Gulen in U.S. federal court in 
Pennsylvania showed that the Turkish government relies on dubious 
proof [[To]] make its case against him. 
That case alleged Gulen issued coded orders [[To]] followers in the 
Turkish judiciary in a 2009 sermon [[To]] persecute members of another 
religious sect. It also alleged that the script of a popular Turkish 
television show was laced with follow[[-]]up messages. The case was 
dismissed by a judge in June. 
Turkish government officials, however, say such evidence is valid 
because Gulen operates covertly and sends encoded messages [[To]] his 
followers. 
Turkey has [[Sent]] the United States new documents in recent days 
containing evidence that Turkish authorities say proves the cleric was

behind the attempted coup. U.S. officials say they are looking through 
them.
