WASHINGTON — As hundreds of thousands of demonstrators 
gathered<https://www.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeednews/womens-
march?utm term=.wra9MGEmBAgtOrQXPW34> on the National Mall to protest President Trump on 
Saturday, people arrested<https://www.buzzfeed.com/zoetillman/rioters-and-police-are-clash-during-trumps-
inauguration> the day before during anti-Trump protests in downtown Washington, DC, made their first 
appearance in court. 
Prosecutors are pursuing charges against all of the 230 people arrested on Friday for rioting, according to the 
US attorney's office in DC. Although anti-Trump demonstrations on inauguration day were largely peaceful, 
some turned violent, with participants breaking storefront windows, throwing bricks at police, and running 
through streets and parks downtown as they were chased by police. 
The arraignment hearing at DC Superior Court began on Saturday around 1 p.m. and was still going six hours 
later. As of 7 p.m., 80 people arrested and charged with felony rioting had come before a judge. The court was 
expected to continue the hearing through the night until everyone arrested on Friday came through. 
The defendants processed so far were released until their next court dates, with the condition that they not be 
arrested again in DC in the meantime. 
Felony rioting is a crime under DC law that carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in jail and a fine of up to 
$25,000. According to police, six officers were injured in confrontations with demonstrators on Jan. 20, and 
three of those officers sustained minor head injuries after objects were thrown at them. The DC law defines 
felony rioting as a group of at least five people who, "by tumultuous and violent conduct and the threat thereof," 
cause "serious bodily harm" or property damage valued at more than $5,000. 
A 21-year-old Texas man was also charged with pointing a laser at at US Park Police helicopter during the 
protests on Friday. He was arraigned in Superior Court but the case is being moved to federal court. 
The individuals charged with rioting were generally brought in front of the judge in groups of 10 and were 
represented by a cadre of public defenders and other court-appointed lawyers. One exception came early in the 
hearing, when former White House counsel Kathryn Ruemmler entered an appearance for one of the 
defendants. Ruemmler said her client was a journalist on assignment filming the demonstrations who was swept 
up in the arrests. 
Ruemmler served as President Obama's White House counsel for three years before going to the law firm 
Latham & Watkins. Ruemmler told reporters outside of the courtroom that her firm represents Vocativ, the 
media company that employed her client, which is how she got involved. 
Dozens of people came to the courthouse on Saturday to support the arrestees. They cheered as defendants left 
the courtroom; some of the defendants were walking slowly to keep their shoes on because they had to remove 
their shoelaces after being arrested. The defendants were held by police overnight.

By Saturday night, a crowd had gathered outside the courthouse to greet the arrestees, cheering and applauding 
as they came out. A line of police formed in between the group and the courthouse entrance, and police were

screening people trying to go inside. 
Several lawyers offered a preview of their defense strategy during the hearing, arguing that the rioting charge 
should be dismissed because prosecutors hadn't shown that each defendant was specifically involved in the 
rioting described in charging documents. Although the defendants were brought out in groups before the judge, 
they're individually charged. 
One lawyer argued that the US attorney's office should recuse from prosecuting the cases because the 
defendants were charged with participating in anti-Trump riots and Trump was now in charge of the US 
Department of Justice. 
"I appreciate all the creative arguments," Magistrate Judge Rainey Brandt said in response, but she said that at 
this early stage of the case she only had to find that the government had shown probable cause to move the 
cases forward. 
The defendants are due back in court on various dates in February and March.

Officials in the nation's capital are throwing the book at anti-Trump protesters —threatening the people who 
were arrested <http ://nyp o st. com/2017/01/20/dozens-arrested-as-anti-trump-protesters-clash-with-p o lice> with 
massive fines and up to 10 years in jail. 
The U.S. attorney's office will seek to charge all 230 of the protesters who took to the streets on Inauguration 
Day — some damaging storefronts and clashing with police — with felony rioting. 
As of Saturday evening, 80 people had already been slapped with the heavy charges, which include fines of up 
to $25,000 and up to 10 years in jail, according to

Felony rioting is defined in D.C. law by at least five people who use "tumultuous and violent conduct of the 
threat thereof' to cause "serious bodily harm" and instigate more than $5,000 in property damage. 
Six local officers were injured by protesters during Trump's big day. The glass windows of several businesses 
were shattered in downtown D.C. including Bank of America, McDonald's and Starbucks. 
All of the people who have already been charged were released on their own recognizance and given their next 
court appearance dates. 
At least one of those arrested was a Vocativ journalist covering the protests, and he was defended by heavy-
hitter and former White House attorney Kathryn Ruemmler, Buzzfeed reported.
