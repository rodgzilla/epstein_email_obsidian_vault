My initial recommendation this morning was [[To]] buy the $200 Aug puts. [[I]] still think that is the best idea. The stock is now 
down 16% on a deal that no one fully understands. The CEO has a good track record regarding mergers. So [[I]] think it 
makes sense [[To]] keep the stock and own protection for the next 35 days until we hopefully get more clarity [[From]] 
management.
