Opening New MEGA Trade:  
Long Saudi Equities ( Buy M1SAP on Swap / Liquidity $100mm a Day)  
- Potentially the EM Flow Story of 2018... if FTSE addition is announced on March 28th we expect an inflow of 
$5bn on a basket which trades 100mm USD a day (50X ADV)... this is even before MSCI announcement in June 
where inflows could be substantially higher 
The Most Powerful Macro Trades are when Macro Fundemantals + Flow Meet... This is Saudi in 2018 
Key Points:  
1. Saudi has significantly underperformed Oil by 14% last 6 months. With the recent introduction of the citizens account programme, 
subsidy cuts, pushing out the budget balance to 2023, and the news of increased handouts, Saudi should re correlate with oil and move higher 
from here. 
2. Saudi equities remain under-owned globally --) foreign ownership of Saudi equities is at 1.3% vs Russia 70%, Turkey 55%, South Africa 
50%, Brazil 45%, UAE 20%, Qatar 10% 
3. Good liquidity vs other EMs but volume trading at lows relative to history -4 Tadawul ADV close to all-time lows at $1bn (10yr range is 
$1-8bn) 
4. Major index events in 2018/19 with FTSE announcement on 28th March next catalyst-4 FTSE announcement could trigger inflows of up 
to $5bn . Combined with the MSCI announcement later this year, potential active and passive inflows can total $15-$40bn. So the potential of at  
least $20bn inflows on a basket which trades 100mm USD a day (200 Days Volume) ?  
5. In comparison, during the MSCI UAE and Qatar inclusions, UAE was trading 10% below historic avg @14x PE and rerated to 22x into MSCI 
EM inclusion with Dubai up +110% (vs +47% prey year). Qatar was trading inline with historic avg @11x PE and rerated to 18x MSCI EM inclusion 
with Qatar up +60% (vs +9% prey year)

6. Saudi risk indicators at 2015 pre-crisis levels 4 Saudi 5yr CDS is trading at 76 vs 40-210 3yr range; SAR 2yr fwd suggests market is less 
worried about depeg fears and forward points can be used as a macro hedge 
7. Valuations & dividend yields remain attractive 4 Market trades at a 10% discount (13.5x) to its historic PE (Saudi PE range is 10-
26x). Avg dividend yield is 3.6% with 45 stocks yield more than 4%.

We think Fed rates expectations 
remain on the low side with just 
marginally more than 1 hike priced, 
We do not think the BoE will hike as 
much as the Fed...................next year when marke 
are pricing marginally more from the 
BoE. 
The risk for equities is a further rise in 
yields led by higher real rates. Last time 
lety real rates were here S&P was closer 
to 2720. 
We see asymmetry in EURGI1P. 
expect EUR to react positively i 
a y/Germarty is neutral/ positive tti 
weekend and ECB pricing to tF 
firmer. On GBP leg, UK politica 
remain underpriced with odds
