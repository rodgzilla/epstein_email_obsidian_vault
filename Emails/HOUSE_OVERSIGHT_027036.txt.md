Absolutely. 23rd is great. I teach my seminar that day at 1 but could tape in the morning or after class--in my 
office (very private), or at the Harvardx studios (less) or in the Woodberry poetry room (the nicest place). . If 
Woody wanted, we could bring some students into the taping or just do the two of us... 
Woody is absolutely welcome to come to the seminar, of course 
John McCain, Tony Kushner, Al Gore have all signed on the last 2 days...crazy
