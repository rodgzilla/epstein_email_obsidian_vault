Dear [[Jeffrey]]-
We are thrilled [[To]] announce that we are working with Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, one of the rising stars in 
the New York Congressional delegation. Sometimes referred [[To]] as "Brooklyn's Barack", he is a staunch 
supporter of President Obama and a progressive voice for the people of New York City. NY1 did a profile piece 
about his work on the vitally important Budget and Judiciary committees in Washington. You can watch the  
video here  or read the text below. 
Hakeem is committed [[To]] electing a Democratic majority in 2014 and is encouraging his friends [[To]] participate in 
the DCCC/DSCC fundraising dinner with President Obama this coming Monday night. Shoot us an email or 
give us a call at (212) 531[[-]]2858 if you would like [[To]] get involved with the dinner, or would like [[To]] get an 
opportunity [[To]] get [[To]] know Hakeem better. He is an impressive guy and who will be a progressive voice in New 
York politics for years [[To]] come. 
Thanks, 
[[Darren]] Rigger, [[Lisa Rossi]] & Walter Swett

NY!: Hakeem Jeffries Positions Himself For Long Career In Washington 
Apr 29, 2013 
By: [[Michael]] Scotto 
Hakeem Jeffries is only about four months into his freshman year in Congress but he's already positioning 
himself for a long career in Washington. NY [[1]] 's [[Michael]] Scotto filed the following report. 
If you're looking [[To]] knock Hakeem Jeffries off message, you won't get very far. 
"There's a hip hop song, every day [[I]]'m hustling, and [[I]] kind of feel that way down here in Washington," Jeffries 
said. "In a positive manner, of course."

The freshman congressman [[From]] Brooklyn and a sliver of Queens is an ambitious work horse who always 
appears [[To]] have his eye on the prize. 
"[[I]]'ll be shuffling back and forth between budget and judiciary for the better part of the morning, making sure we 
time it correctly so that [[I]]'m able [[To]] ask questions in both situations," he said. 
He's a big change [[From]] Congressman [[Ed]] Towns, who retired after holding the seat for 30 years. 
On any given day, Jeffries is traveling through the Capitol, attending hearings on the Judiciary and Budget 
committees, two of the most prominent in the lower chamber. 
For Jeffries, those two assignments allow him [[To]] serve as a counterweight [[To]] the Republican leadership and [[To]] 
talk up the President, whom he and his district overwhelmingly support. 
"My job, [[I]] believe, is [[To]] help the administration of Barack Obama help us back at home," Jeffries said. 
In his first four months, Jeffries has championed himself as a progressive, introducing legislation [[To]] help student 
loan recipients and voting against a bill Friday [[To]] ease the impact of automatic spending cuts [[To]] the FAA 
because it didn't stop cuts [[To]] programs that are impacting the poor. 
In the months and years ahead, Jeffries says there's plenty [[To]] do. 
"There's no shortage of the people's business down in Washington, D.C. and that's why the job is one that is a 
serious endeavor," he said. 
A serious endeavor that is also very much on message.
