Broward Probe: 302 Reasons Not [[To]] Talk [[To]] The [[Fbi]] 
BY SAM FIELDS 
Guest Columnist 
Actually, there are not 302 reasons. There is but one and it is called in federal court ""The 302". It 
could screw the innocent and the unwary. 
The newspapers and Browardbeat.[[Com]] make clear that the Federal investigations that led [[To]] the arrests 
of County Commissioner Josephus Eggleston, former Miramar Commissioner Fitzroy Salesman and 
School Board member Bev Gallagher are just beginning. 
The [[Fbi]] will be interviewing everyone [[From]] County Administrator Bertha Henry [[To]] bus drivers about 
anything and everything. 
They are looking for scalps. 
[[I]] suspect that if the average person thought about it, he would assume that when the [[Fbi]] comes calling, 
.like Joe Friday [[From]] DRAGNET, they "want the facts and nothing but the facts."" Equally important 
they want an accurate record of that interview so they bring a court reporter or at the very least a tape 
recorder. 
The average person would be wrong. 
Agents bring a pencil and pad [[To]] take notes. They then prepare a summary of the interview called a 
"302 Report." 
If you are called as a witness at trial, prior [[To]] testifying, you will be given a copy of "Your 302" [[To]] 
review. It is a record of what the [[Fbi]] insists you said at your previous meeting. 
If your interview lasted more than thirty seconds, it is guaranteed you will fmd numerous discrepancies. 
Some of them will be insignificant; some of them could be material.

Ask two people [[To]] listen [[To]] you in a discussion about a traffic accident and then write a summary. It is a 
guaranteed they will have differences with each other as well as with you, the witness. 
You said, "[[I]] am reasonably sure that the traffic light was green"". 
One report takes out the equivocation and quotes you as saying: "The light was green." 
This brings us [[To]] Federal law 18 USC 1001. That statute makes it a felony [[To]] lie [[To]] the government. And 
guess who decides whether or not you were lying? The government. 
So here is your conundrum. Do you testify about your doubts about the light, which is the truth, or do
