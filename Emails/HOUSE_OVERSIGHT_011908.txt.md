Dear JeanLuc, 
Unfortunately I need to announce that Liza Zazdravnih rejected signing the contract with MC2 in United 
Sates. Initially she intended to sign the contract, but later on she came across that article in internet about 
you involved in illegal activities with young models. This information somehow changed her intentions 
completely. she is ready to be a model and consider contracts with other agencies, but she has 
suspicions that you will force her to illegal activities and she made the decision to don't put her self in risk. 
Lets keep in touch. I will be happy to work with you next time if we have another right model for you. Im 
upset that it didn't work out with Liza 
Sincerely, 
Vladimir
