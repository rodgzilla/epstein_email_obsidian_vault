[[I]]'m against censorship, and that includes [[Kathy]] Griffin. CNN eats chickenshit. What she 
did is nothing compared [[To]] Trump's murderous evil. 
P.S. THIS LITERALLY REEKS WITH IRONY...THIS IS WHERE CNN GETS ITS 
CHICKENSHIT. A COMMERCIAL THAT THEY'RE LOSING BECAUSE OF [[Kathy]]: 
SQUATTY POTTY - [[Kathy]] GRIFFIN "FULL OF SHIT" (2017) 
(USA) 
09 May, 201/ By Dabitch 0 Comments 
Second week of May this [[Kathy]] Griffin ad rolls out digital media only, where [[Kathy]] tells people that they are "full of 
shit." Literally. See, [[Kathy]] Griffin has a potty mouth but also a selling point - the reason you'd use the squatty potty 
is [[To]] properly empty your bowels. "It's like a colonic" she explains, but without that hose up your ass. A cute blue 
turd bleeps her potty mouth but the point is still made. 
You may remember Squatty Potty's pooping unicorn video created by the Harmon Brothers in 2015. Now [[Kathy]] 
Griffin is their first celebrity spokesperson. The brand's CEO and co[[-]]creator, Bobby Edwards, finds her quirky, brave 
and fearless, which makes her a good ambassador for the brand as they target women with this campaign. 
Edwards says the brand team fell in love with the "full of shit" idea [[From]] Bravery Films, "it got the biggest laughs" 
[[From]] staff. Howie Ronay, Bravery Films' founder and chief creative officer, a former FCB exec who worked on the 
2013 viral hit "Ship My Pants" for Kmart explains: "We know a lot of people struggle with this issue, and we decided 
[[To]] take a common colloquial phrase and use it literally." Basically, this is "ship my pants [[Ii]]." Enough about poop, not 
all ads can be great.
