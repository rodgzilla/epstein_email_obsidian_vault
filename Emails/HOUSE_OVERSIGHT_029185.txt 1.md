Hi Lawrence, 
just back from a long tour ,,on origins". 
As promised you will get my message promptly. 
As you may understand, before we start recruiting for the Festival our budget 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029185 
implies more freedom. Now I simply do not have the flexibility to decide so easily 
on amounts in „kilos". (especially as a prominent Nobel laureate shortly before 
deadline agreed to come and implied a pretty large sum). 
What I can offer you is 5k as a lump sum. This is the ultimate at the moment. 
I deeply regret these limitations but I cannot ignore redlines. 
So please let me know if you can or cannot come. 
As ever Jakob

Hi.. update.. noam cannot do anything anyway.. nor UK that week.. So, I have been able confirm I can get the 
ticket for the discounted amount of 4500 Euros.. Are you game with my proposal? I have until end of Sept to

Well it depends on UK.. if they can't do it, then alas, it would be the whole thing.. I could check for a discount 
ticket of course.. and maybe even economy class... There is also a small chance that I might do the event in UK 
with Noam Chomsky, and I am wondering whether, if I could convince him to join me in a dialogue at your 
place whether that might change the dynamics of the event for you, and free up some more money perhaps..

Hi Lawrence 
your mail meets me on the way out to a week abroad. 
I need my financial colleague to decide. So, I shall be 
back at the end of this month. 
What would our share be?

Hi Jakob

There has been a complication. The Gottingen event had to be cancelled so that means I now do not have an air ticket to Germany. I 
am going to check whether I can arrange anything in the Uk which might cover part of the cost for a new ticket. In the meantime I 
thought I should let you know and ask whether it is possible to cover part or all of the cost for a ticket. 
Lawrence.
