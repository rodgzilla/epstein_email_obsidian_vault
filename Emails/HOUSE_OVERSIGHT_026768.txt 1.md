Message: Hi, 
We are journalists at BuzzFeed News, reporting an investigation about sexual harassment 
allegations against Lawrence Krauss between 2006 to 2016. 
Much of the story revolves around his conduct in the skeptics movement, and about how skeptic 
organizations — particularly CFI — have handled complaints about his behavior. 
We wanted to give you — as a leader of the atheist movement and one of Krauss's collaborators — 
the opportunity to comment on these allegations. 
We plan to publish on Tuesday morning. Let us know soon if you'd like to comment.
