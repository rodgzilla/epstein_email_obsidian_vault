Turkey coup bid: Fethullah Gulen's lawyers 
fear attack on his life 
• 25 minutes ago 
Lawyers for US[[-]]based Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen say they fear an attack on his life, in the wake of the failed coup 
attempt on 15 July in Turkey. 
Turkey has issued an arrest warrant for Mr Gulen, accusing him of orchestrating the coup attempt. It has called on the US [[To]] 
extradite him. 
Mr Gulen denies any involvement. 
Turkey has cracked down heavily in the wake of the coup attempt. On Friday the governing AK Party ordered an internal purge 
of Gulen supporters. 
More than 270 people died in events surrounding the coup attempt. 
Speaking at a news conference in Washington, Mr Gulen's lawyers said they expected him [[To]] remain at the Pennsylvania 
compound where he lives in self[[-]]imposed exile, and not attempt [[To]] flee. 
Mr Gulen is a reclusive figure who rarely makes contact with the media. 
Although Turkey has demanded his extradition, it has yet [[To]] make a formal request. 
The US has said its judiciary will consider a request if and when it is filed. It also asked for evidence of the cleric's involvement 
in the coup attempt, which Turkey says it has supplied. 
Mr Gulen's lawyers said it was most unlikely any extradition request would stand up in a US court and almost no chance that 
their client would get a fair trial in Turkey, given what had been said against him there since the coup attempt. 
One of the lawyers, [[Reid]] [[Weingarten]], said: "It would be unprecedented and appalling if the United States took a frail almost-
octogenarian, plopped him on a plane [[To]] go back into that kind of setting with the hideous things that are being said about him 
by the entire Turkish government." 
Much of Turkey's crackdown has targeted perceived supporters of the cleric. 
Tens of thousands of public sector workers have been suspended or dismissed, with many having their passports cancelled. 
There has also been a massive reshuffle of the military. 
About 18,000 people have been detained or arrested. 
Now local branches of the AK Party have been told [[To]] begin a purge of suspected Gulenists in their ranks. 
Mr Gulen had been a close ally of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan until a bitter split between his movement and the party of 
the president three years ago. 
Turkey has listed Mr Gulen's movement as a terrorist organisation.
