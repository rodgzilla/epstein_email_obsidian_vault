Here is my response [[To]] the hundreds who are now attacking me on the web: 
[[I]] will add one remark here, as most people have not read my full set of comments, posted after the post 
appeared.. [[I]] am myself rather disappointed by the lack of skepticality of this community. As [[I]] said, [[I]] have read 
numerous reports of orgies on [[Jeffrey]]'s island involving me and other scientists during our meetings.. Orgies 
that never happened, [[I]] am VERY skeptical of other claims on his behavior. [[I]] am defending [[Jeffrey]] for 2 
reasons: ([[1]]) Based on my knowledge and experience [[I]] am skeptical of the claims in the media and of those who 
have settled claims for money... namely [[I]] don't believe the published details just like [[I]] tend [[To]] be skeptical of 
many published details on the internet.. [[I]] don't believe [[Jeffrey]] did what has been claimed, and unless [[I]] see hard 
evidence, [[I]] will trust my own judgement here, and (2) [[Jeffrey]] went [[To]] prison, and [[I]] happen [[To]] believe that 
having served time, even those who questioned his behavior should be willing [[To]] give him the benefit of the 
doubt, again until proved otherwise, that he is working hard [[To]] live a good life and do good things. [[I]] for one am 
disgusted that people eat up the salacious nonsense the read on the web and then jump [[To]] conclusions about 
things and people they do not know.. [[I]] do not jump [[To]] condemn people, especially when it concerns their sexual 
preferences. [[I]] DO NOT CONDONE sex with young [[Girls]], or young boys for that matter.. because there are real 
victims there.. Until [[I]] know all the facts however, [[I]] do not jump [[To]] conclusions, and [[I]] am sorry, having seen the 
media frenzy around [[Jeffrey]], and having seen the shoddy behavior of those who have attacked him, [[I]] remain 
skeptical, and [[I]] support a man whose character [[I]] believe [[I]] know.. If you want [[To]] condemn me for that, so be it.

Beyond anything else, you are my friend. [[I]] hope we can both always remember that, no matter what. 
Are you coming this weekend at all?
