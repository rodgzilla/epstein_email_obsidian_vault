Dear Jeffrey, 
I arrived from Brazil on January 19th, knowing that I had to remember something very important on January 
20th and it was not Trump's inauguration. As I arrived too tired, I kept thinking, but could not remember. Just 
now seeing your e-mail I remembered what it was!!! Your birthday!!! Please accept our best wishes for your 
new year! 
Hope you had a good celebration! 
We had to postpone our trip to Arizona and are still in Cambridge, leaving on Wednesday. Noam and I hope to 
see you again soon and have a toast for your birthday.
