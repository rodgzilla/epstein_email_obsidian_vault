Any further intel on Treasury? Priebus choice suggests [[To]] me that he may go for a bigger name in 
treasury than Mnuchin. Someone [[To]] underscore/push forward this notion that he is Reagan 2.0 (as 
some are suggesting). [[I]] am just not sure who that person would be. The Trump trade certainly seems 
[[To]] have legs -- all the Hillary loving hedgies [[I]] am talking [[To]] are congratulating themselves for making 
so much money last week. They are all Trump lovers now!
