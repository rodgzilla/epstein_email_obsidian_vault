Brad — 
In your answers to ROGS, you list Milton Center for girls as facility that Jane Doe attended. Milton Center is a 
Department of Juvenile Justice facility; therefore I will need to get her records from DJJ. DJJ will not release the records 
without a signed release by Jane Doe. I have attached a general HIPPA release for your review. Would you please have 
Jane Doe sign it? DJJ does not have a standard form. 
Also, will you agree to one more week on Responses to Net Wirth ROGS?? 
Please let me know.
