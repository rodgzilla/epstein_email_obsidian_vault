Dear [[Jeffrey]], 
My name is [[Leah Reis-dennis]], and [[I]]'ll be heading operations for Lisa's new non[[-]]profit, Verse Video Education. 
She's asked me [[To]] be in touch with you about helping us get a release [[From]] Woody Allen. 
First, [[I]] wanted [[To]] send along the rough stringout of footage [[From]] the conversation with Woody a couple of years 
ago on "This is Just [[To]] Say" by William Carlos Williams. This is totally unedited and uncut footage, but we 
would love the opportunity [[To]] turn it into something great. 
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cObnljj xeo0654g/uWZ6KBVbLS?preview=WoodyAllen+Basic+Clip+for+Viewing.mov  
If Woody Allen agrees [[To]] let us use the footage, he will be in distinguished company. [[To]] [[Date]], we have filmed 
conversations about poetry with dozens of distinguished Americans including: 
Bill Clinton 
Al Gore 
John McCain 
Mayor Rahm Emanuel 
Mayor [[Tom]] Menino 
Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan 
Sir Mervyn [[King]] 
Former Secretary of the Treasury [[Larry]] [[Summers]] 
The conversation would be part of a large multiplatform initiative that Harvard Professor [[Lisa New]] has under 
way [[To]] bring poetry into the mainstream, and, especially, into English Language Arts classrooms in the United 
States and around the world. The initiative, Poetry in America, includes a HarvardX online course, a television 
series we're creating with WGBH [[To]] be paired with PBS LearningMedia segments for the classroom, and, a 
series of online professional development courses we're creating for ELA Middle and High School teachers and 
for their students. 
Let us know if Woody Allen might be open [[To]] our sending another release form his way. Of course, if he's 
interested in releasing the footage for only certain parts of our project, we're open [[To]] having a conversation 
about that, too. 
Thank you, and [[I]] hope [[To]] meet you soon. 
Best, Leah
