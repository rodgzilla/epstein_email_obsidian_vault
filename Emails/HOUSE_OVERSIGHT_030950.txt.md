What else are you interested in? Peter is best for currency; maybe [[Reid]] Hoffman (fatty at LinkedIn) or Dave 
Morin (Path) or Drew Houston (Dropbox). 
[[I]] do believe China offers the best opportunities for Sinofsky. Problem is after Windows, pretty much everything 
else in the US is a step down. No[[-]]one else is building an OS. Alibaba or Xiaomi in China are. But if he wants [[To]] 
stay in the US, then probably the best options are Facebook (who may one day do their own OS), Palantir (Peter 
Thiel's), Yahoo (where Marissa is aggressively seeking out senior talent). Then of course, there is Apple and 
Google - but [[I]] assume he doesn't want [[To]] be a traitor [[To]] Microsoft?

Are you back now in NY? 
[[I]]'m in London but staying up [[To]] watch the Obama speech. Hosain's really keen [[To]] close this out by Monday.... 
It would help me a lot if we can finish this for once and for all. 
[[I]]'m in Munich Saturday, then St. Petersburg and Moscow with Eike Sunday[[-]]Tuesday (we've got some terrific 
meetings lined up), London Wednesday[[-]]Thursday (including Mubadala board meeting Wed.) and then heading 
[[To]] SF next Friday 14th.... you will arrive on the 16th? Shall we do [[Peter Thiel]] for drinks then? 
Best wishes, 
Ian
