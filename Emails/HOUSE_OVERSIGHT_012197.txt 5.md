Fli Jay — Sorry to be a bother, but do you have a copy that at least contains Mr. Epstein's 
signature? I need to pass it along to the powers that be. Thanks.

Subject RE: Other attorneys

Hi Jay — Can you give me a call at his morning? I am meeting with the agents 
and want to give them their marching orders regarding what they can tell the girls. 
Also, please remove Babbitt and Searcy from the list. There is too great a chance of an 
appearance of impropriety with Babbitt and I received a bad report about Searcy last night. 
Thank you.
