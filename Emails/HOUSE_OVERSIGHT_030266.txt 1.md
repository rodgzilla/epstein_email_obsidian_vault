Lawyer [[Alan]] Dershowitz has said that he still represents 
convicted pedophile [[Jeffrey]] [[Epstein]], who pleaded guilty [[To]] 
soliciting underage sexual partners whom he initially 
recruited as masseurs. Dershowitz, 80, told Axios that 
[[Epstein]] "has called me a couple of times about legal issues, 
because [[I]]'m still technically his lawyer," adding, "[[I]] haven't 
had any social, or any other kind of contact [but] you never 
stop being a person's lawyer." Dershowitz told Axios that 
[[Epstein]] lent his family his Palm Beach, Florida, house and 
that he received a "therapeutic massage with an old old 
Russian" there, but he'd had no idea "anything improper had 
even taken place in that house." While he was allegedly 
raping teenage [[Girls]], [[Epstein]] cultivated relationships with a 
global elite: Bill Clinton flew on [[Epstein]]'s plane, nicknamed 
the "Lolita Express," numerous times; Prince Andrew's ex-

wife borrowed money [[From]] him; and Donald Trump praised 
him as a "terrific guy."
