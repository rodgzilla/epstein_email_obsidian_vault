RE: Do you have a signed copy? 
Thank you, Jay. I have forwarded your message only to Alex, Andy, and Rolando. I don't 
anticipate it going any further than that. When I receive the originals, I will sign and return one 
copy to you. The other will be placed in the case file, which will be kept confidential since it also 
contains identifying information about the girls. 
When we reach an agreement about the attorney representative for the girls, we can discuss 
what I can tell him and the girls about the agreement. I know that Andy promised Chief Reiter 
an update when a resolution was achieved. (Something I wouldn't have promised in light of what 
happened last year.) Rolando is calling, but Rolando knows not to tell Chief Reiter about the 
money issue, just about what crimes Mr. Epstein is pleading guilty to and the amount of time that 
has been agreed to. Rolando also is telling Chief Reiter not to disclose the outcome to anyone.
