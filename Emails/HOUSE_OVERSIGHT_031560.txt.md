Personal/Political bias is one thing (I still would exploit it any and every time on cross); this was an obsession and directly 
relevant "Stop Trump." Also, the IG made clear in his testimony Strzok told him McCabe was there. McCabe is another 
real character. He denies this; but he also is irreconcilably at odds with Comey on WSJ leak. Absolutely right that taking 
emails alone is not fair; but I would point out that it is folks like Strzok and company who have ruined many a 
businesman's life based exclusively on a twisted reading of emails sold to a jury. Flynn is an interesting case. I believe I 
could have gotten his plea back for him in a second based on what has surfaced; but he decided to go a different 
way. But as to your underlying point that there might well be something to go after with these guys, I hear you; but I have 
spent my whole career fighting bullies and crooked, unethical prosecutors. That will remain a guiding principle for me, 
whether the target is popular, hated, a complete jerk, guilty, etc. I am doing ok, thanks. I see you really follow this stuff.
