Hi Jay — These four people were recommended. I have not contacted them to find out what their 
rates are. All are very active in the plaintiffs' bar in the West Palm area. Ted Babbitt would be 
my first choice of these four but I think he is conflicted out because one of his partners is 
married to an AUSA here. Stuart Grossman is probably my second choice.

Talk to Jack Goldberger about this group. They are all very good personal injury lawyers, but I 
have concerns about whether there would be an inherent tension because they may feel that 
THEY might make more money (and get a lot more press coverage) if they proceed outside the 
terms of the plea agreement. (Sorry — I just have a bias against plaintiffs' attorneys.) One nice 
thing about Bert is that he is in Miami where there has been almost no coverage of this case. 
Just so you know, I have never met Bert, but a good friend in our appellate section and one of the 
district judges in Miami are good friends with him and recommended him. 
Can you let me know tomorrow? I am going to be out for a while starting on Friday, and I 
would like to get this underway before I leave. 
Thank you.

Subject RE: Proposed Letter to Special Master 
WMPRWIr 
EA*76-41.4gR,V' 
Good morning, Jay. We need to resolve the attorney issue today. It has been 
weeks since execution of the contract, and there is no need for further delay. 
As far as the five attorney names that we will be providing, I propose Bert 
Ocariz, Katherine Ezell at Podhurst Orseck, Stuart Grossman, Ed Rogers, and 
Walter Cobath. 
If you would like to use the same Special Master to resolve fees disputes as 
well as to handle the selection of the attorney, I would recommend that we use 
retired 11th Circuit Judge Joseph Hatchett instead of Judge Davis because of 
Judge Davis's health problems. (No one has contacted Judge Hatchett yet, but 
one of the District Judges in Miami mentioned him as a good choice.) 
I am available for a conference call between 9:00 and 10:00, and between 3:15 
and 6:00. Please call me on my cell and let me know which of 
those times works best for you. 
Thank you.
