Hi Danny,
Thanks. Can you send me a PDF of the cover page?
Who issued that order?
We always get such court documents -- with the names and ID of victims redacted.
The whole document is not withheld.

Hi Sue - I've confirmed that the brief is filed under seal. It contains the following header on the cover
page: "Pursuant to Civil Rights Law§ 50-b, the identities of the victims, who are the victims of sex
offenses, shall be confidential, and this document shall not be made available for public inspection."
Accordingly we must decline your request. Thanks.
