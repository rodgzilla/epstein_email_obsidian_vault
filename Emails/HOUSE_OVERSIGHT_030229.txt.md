Maz is the most devious and cunning of the bunch. However, Editors can pay for people, stories and documents. They can even pay 
criminals if it is in the public interest. 
Maz can pay who he wants for info but the Yorkshire Ripper for instance, as a convicted criminal, can't sell his story.. unless in public 
interest cos there was say, a bent detective. 
Below is [[From]] PCC Code for Editors. It is not well drafted.

Witness payments in criminal trials 
[[I]]) No payment or offer of payment [[To]] a witness - or any person who 
may reasonably be expected [[To]] be called as a witness - should be made 
in any case once proceedings are active as defmed by the Contempt of 
Court Act 1981. 
This prohibition lasts until the suspect has been freed 
unconditionally by police without charge or bail or the proceedings 
are otherwise discontinued; or has entered a guilty plea [[To]] the court; 
or, in the event of a not guilty plea, the court has announced its 
verdict. 
*[[Ii]]) Where proceedings are not yet active but are likely and 
foreseeable, editors must not make or offer payment [[To]] any person who 
may reasonably be expected [[To]] be called as a witness, unless the 
information concerned ought demonstrably [[To]] be published in the public 
interest and there is an over[[-]]riding need [[To]] make or promise payment 
for this [[To]] be done; and all reasonable steps have been taken [[To]] 
ensure no financial dealings influence the evidence those witnesses 
give. In no circumstances should such payment be conditional on the 
outcome of a trial. 
*iii) Any payment or offer of payment made [[To]] a person later cited [[To]] 
give evidence in proceedings must be disclosed [[To]] the prosecution and

defence. The witness must be advised of this requirement.

*Payment [[To]] criminals 
[[I]]) Payment or offers of payment for stories, pictures or information, 
which seek [[To]] exploit a particular crime or [[To]] glorify or glamorise 
crime in general, must not be made directly or [[Via]] agents [[To]] convicted 
or confessed criminals or [[To]] their associates — who may include 
family, friends and colleagues. 
[[Ii]]) Editors invoking the public interest [[To]] justify payment or offers 
would need [[To]] demonstrate that there was good reason [[To]] believe the 
public interest would be served. If, despite payment, no public 
interest emerged, then the material should not be published.
