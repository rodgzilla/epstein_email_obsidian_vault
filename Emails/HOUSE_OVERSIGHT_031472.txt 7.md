Thank you, [[Kathy]]. [[I]] think for now the FTP site is the right choice for getting it in the hands of reporters. We don't want it 
too accessible [[To]] people who might slice it up, and a youtube link would travel faster, [[I]] believe. We eventually want [[To]] 
trim the video into chunks and post on YouTube through AFSV's channels.
