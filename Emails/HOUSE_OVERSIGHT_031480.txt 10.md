All,

I just received a copy of the audio recording with Q&A. The video recording will be available mid-to-late afternoon. As 
the file will be too large to distribute via email, we have two posting options: 
a) Upload to Steptoe's FTP site, where the file is public but not (easily) discoverable to the casual Steptoe.com browser or 
searcher. We would send reporters the link, at which point they would download the recording in order to watch it. 
B) Upload the file to Steptoe's YouTube channel and set the security around the video so that it's only watchable by 
someone who has the link. It would not be discoverable by anyone who doesn't have the exact URL (searching or 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031487 
browsing). The advantage with this option is the reporters could watch the video via the YouTube player, rather than 
downloading a file. 
I believe our preference is the second choice? 
Thanks, 
Kathy
