fred gave him 15k as a 3 year old only. however ( written 200k in "todays dollars" ) then they compound 
their silliness, stating that he was a millonair at age 8.? all silly, . if fred put 2k in treasuries the same 
year ,and didnt invest it it would be worth 1 million today. instead he invested in real estate. taxes on estates 
and gigts are taxed on the value of what was transferred not the underlying thing. ex if you own 10 percent 
of a partnership interest in a 1 million builidng that cannot be sold for 20 years. what is the value of your 
interest. not 10 percent of 1 million as you only own a ltd partnership right. maybe 2 percent. its all legal
