Hi Jeffery — 
[[I]] just wanted [[To]] follow up on a couple of notes. [[I]] have been coordinating with [[Richard Kahn]] (copied), and [[I]] have [[Sent]] 
along [[To]] him the invoice and donation letter. So, we are all set on that front. 
[[I]] also wanted [[To]] circle back around on Peggy's note below. Will you indeed be attending the ceremony this year? Also, 
you had indicated you would have three additional guests as well. If you are available [[To]] attend the ceremony, please 
let us know, as well as [[To]] provide us with the names of your three guests. (Security is extra tight this year, with 
honoring Al Gore and all, and everyone's names have [[To]] be on the list [[To]] attend). 
Thanks so much, and look forward hearing more on this. 
Best, 
Steven
