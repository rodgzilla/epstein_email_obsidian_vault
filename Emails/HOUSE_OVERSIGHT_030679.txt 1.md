Hi Jeffery — 
I just wanted to follow up on a couple of notes. I have been coordinating with Richard Kahn (copied), and I have sent 
along to him the invoice and donation letter. So, we are all set on that front. 
I also wanted to circle back around on Peggy's note below. Will you indeed be attending the ceremony this year? Also, 
you had indicated you would have three additional guests as well. If you are available to attend the ceremony, please 
let us know, as well as to provide us with the names of your three guests. (Security is extra tight this year, with 
honoring Al Gore and all, and everyone's names have to be on the list to attend). 
Thanks so much, and look forward hearing more on this. 
Best, 
Steven
