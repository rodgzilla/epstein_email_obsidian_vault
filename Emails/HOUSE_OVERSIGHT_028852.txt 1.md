Sorry again for that last minute cancellation in the Spring -- alas, 
the perils of running a new center, that [[I]] no longer control my 
schedule like in the good old days. But the Obama BRAIN Initiative is 
running strong, and MIT has a good bid for a seat at the table, so 
that is good. Want [[To]] revisit a time for a chat? My schedule is now 
much more free, thanks [[To]] these BRAIN initiative activities 
launching... 
Best, 
[[Ed]]

Good morning Neil.. .[[1]] am afraid [[Jeffrey]] must cancel his trip up today...he is sick in bed and not well. [[I]] am so 
very sorry [[To]] do this last minute. Hopefully we can circle back [[To]] this soon. 
Thank you, 
Lesley
